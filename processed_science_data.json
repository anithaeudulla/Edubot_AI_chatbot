show two different types movement – one dependent growth independent growth 621 immediate response stimulus let us think first kind movement sensitive plant since growth involved plant must actually move leaves response touch nervous tissue muscle tissue plant detect touch leaves move response figure 64 figure 64 figure 64 figure 64 figure 64 sensitive plant think exactly plant touched part plant actually moves apparent movement happens point different point touch information touch occurred must communicated plants also use electricalchemical means convey information cell cell unlike animals specialised tissue plants conduction information finally animals cells must change shape order movement happen instead specialised proteins found animal muscle cells plant cells change shape changing amount water resulting swelling shrinking therefore changing shapes fig 64 622 movement due growth plants like pea plant climb plants fences means tendrils tendrils sensitive touch come contact
