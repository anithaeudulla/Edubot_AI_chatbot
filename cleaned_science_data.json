Our elders tell\nus that the ‘environment’ is not what it used to be earlier; others say that\nwe should work in a healthy ‘environment’; and global summits involving\nthe developed and developing countries are regularly held to discuss\n‘environmental’ issues. In this chapter, we shall be studying how various\ncomponents in the environment interact with each other and how we\nimpact the environment.\n13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO\n13.1 ECO-SYSTEM — WHA\n-SYSTEM — WHA\n-SYSTEM — WHA\n-SYSTEM — WHA\n-SYSTEM — WHAT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nT ARE ITS COMPONENTS?\nAll organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human\nbeings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other\nand maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an\narea together with the non-living constituents of the environment form\nan ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components\ncomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising\nphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals.\nFor example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such\nas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;\nand animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes.\nThese are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-\nmade (artificial) ecosystems.\nn\nYou might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one.\nn\nWhat are the things that we need to keep in mind when we create\nan aquarium? The fish would need a free space for swimming (it\ncould be a large jar), water, oxygen and food.\nn\nWe can provide oxygen through an oxygen pump (aerator) and\nfish food which is available in the market.\n2024-25\n\nOur Environment\n209\nn\nIf we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a self-\nsustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquarium\nis an example of a human-made ecosystem.\nn\nCan we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does\nit have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds\nor lakes in the same manner? Why or why not?\nWe have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped as\nproducers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in\nwhich they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall\nwhat we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by\nus above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll? All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers.\nOrganisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for\ntheir sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,\neither directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers\nare the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,\ncarnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of\nthese categories of consumers?\nn\nImagine the situation where you do not clean the  aquarium and\nsome fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what\nhappens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising\nbacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste\nproducts of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers\nas they break-down the complex organic substances into simple\ninorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once\nmore by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead\nanimals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment\nof the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there?\nActivity 13.2\nActivity 13.2\nActivity 13.2\nActivity 13.2\nActivity 13.2\nn\nWhile creating an aquarium did you take care not to put an aquatic\nanimal which would eat others? What would have happened\notherwise?\nn\nMake groups and discuss how each of the above groups of\norganisms are dependent on each other.\nn\nWrite the aquatic organisms in order of who eats whom and form\na chain of at least three steps. \n → \n → \nn\nWould you consider any one group of organisms to be of primary\nimportance? Why or why not?\n2024-25\n\nScience\n210\nFigure 13.2\nFigure 13.2\nFigure 13.2\nFigure 13.2\nFigure 13.2\nTrophic levels\n13.1.1 Food Chains and Webs\nIn Activity 13.4 we have formed a series of organisms feeding\non one another. This series or organisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1).\nEach step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level.\nThe autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level.\nThey fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2).\nWe know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another. As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nto the heterotrophs and decomposers. However, as we saw in\nthe previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form\nof energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to the\nenvironment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that –\nn\nThe green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy.\nn\nWhen green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers.\nn\nTherefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers.\nn\nSince so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nfood chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels.\nn\nThere are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers.\nn\nThe length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3).\nFigure 13.1\nFigure 13.1\nFigure 13.1\nFigure 13.1\nFigure 13.1\nFood chain in nature\n(a) in forest, (b) in\ngrassland and (c) in a\npond\n2024-25\n\nOur Environment\n211\nFrom the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),\ntwo things become clear. Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level.\nSecondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level.\nAnother interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. You have read in Class IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests.\nThese chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies. From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\nFigure 13.4  \nFigure 13.4  \nFigure 13.4  \nFigure 13.4  \nFigure 13.4  Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystem\nFigure 13.3\nFigure 13.3\nFigure 13.3\nFigure 13.3\nFigure 13.3\nFood web, consisting of\nmany food chains\n2024-25\n\nScience\n212\nActivity 13.3\nActivity 13.3\nActivity 13.3\nActivity 13.3\nActivity 13.3\nand animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain.\nAs these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated\nprogressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top\nlevel in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals\nget accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological\nmagnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat\nand rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts\nof pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or\nother means.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhat are trophic levels? Give an example of a food chain and state the\ndifferent trophic levels in it.\n2.\nWhat is the role of decomposers in the ecosystem?\n13.2\n13.2\n13.2\n13.2\n13.2\nHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE\nHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE\nHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE\nHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE\nHOW DO OUR ACTIVITIES AFFECT THE\nENVIRONMENT?\nENVIRONMENT?\nENVIRONMENT?\nENVIRONMENT?\nENVIRONMENT?\nWe are an integral part of the environment. Changes in the environment\naffect us and our activities change the environment around us. We have\nalready seen in Class IX how our activities pollute the environment. In\nthis chapter, we shall be looking at two of the environmental problems\nin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal.\n13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted\nOzone (O3) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O2,\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However, at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation\nn\nNewspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts. Debate in groups the need for such bans.\nn\nWhat do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food\nitems? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source through\nother food products too?\nn\nDiscuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of\npesticides.\n2024-25\n\nOur Environment\n213\nActivity 13.5\nActivity 13.5\nActivity 13.5\nActivity 13.5\nActivity 13.5\nActivity 13.4\nActivity 13.4\nActivity 13.4\nActivity 13.4\nActivity 13.4\nis highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin\ncancer in human beings.\nOzone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV\nradiation acting on oxygen (O2) molecule. The higher energy UV\nradiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O2) into free oxygen (O)\natoms. These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form\nozone as shown—\nO\nO+O\n2\nUV\n\n→\n\nO\nO\nO\n2\n3\nOzone)\n+\n→\n(\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.\nn\nCollect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and broken footwear.\nn\nBury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil.\nn\nKeep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals.\nn\nWhat are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time?\nn\nWhat are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time?\nn\nOf these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest?\nn\nFind out from the library, internet or newspaper reports, which\nchemicals are responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer.\nn\nFind out if the regulations put in place to control the emission of\nthese chemicals have succeeded in reducing the damage to the\nozone layer. Has the size of the hole in the ozone layer changed in\nrecent years?\n13.2.2 Managing the Garbage we Produce\nIn our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrown\naway. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n214\nWe have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat is\ndigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why\nthe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down\nof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes.\nThese materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and\npressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time.\nSubstances that are broken down by biological processes are said\nto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner\nare said to be non-biodegradable. These substances may be inert and\nsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system.\nActivity 13.6\nActivity 13.6\nActivity 13.6\nActivity 13.6\nActivity 13.6\nn\nUse the library or internet to find out more about biodegradable\nand non-biodegradable substances.\nn\nHow long are various non-biodegradable substances expected to\nlast in our environment?\nn\nThese days, new types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable\nare available.

Visit any place of tourist interest and we are sure to find the\nplace littered with empty food wrappers. In the earlier classes we have\ntalked about this problem of dealing with the garbage that we generate.

Changes in attitude also have a role to play,\nwith more and more things we use becoming disposable. Changes in\npackaging have resulted in much of our waste becoming non-\nbiodegradable.

The introduction of\ndisposable cups was hailed as a step forward for reasons of hygiene. No one at that time\nperhaps thought about the impact caused by the disposal of millions of these cups on a\ndaily basis. Some time back, kulhads, that is, disposable cups made of clay, were\nsuggested as an alternative. But a little thought showed that making these kulhads on\na large scale would result in the loss of the fertile top-soil. Now disposable paper-cups\nare being used.

    "jesc109": "Science\n134\nLight – Reflection and\nRefraction\n9\nCHAPTER\nW\ne see a variety of objects in the world around us. However, we are\nunable to see anything in a dark room. On lighting up the room,\nthings become visible. What makes things visible? During the day, the\nsunlight helps us to see objects. An object reflects light that falls on it.\nThis reflected light, when received by our eyes, enables us to see things.\nWe are able to see through a transparent medium as light is transmitted\nthrough it. There are a number of common wonderful phenomena\nassociated with light such as image formation by mirrors, the twinkling\nof stars, the beautiful colours of a rainbow, bending of light by a medium\nand so on.  A study of the properties of light helps us to explore them.\nBy observing the common optical phenomena around us, we may\nconclude that light seems to travel in straight lines. The fact that a small\nsource of light casts a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this\nstraight-line path of light, usually indicated as a ray of light.\nMore to Know!\nIf an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small, light has a tendency to\nbend around it and not walk in a straight line – an effect known as the diffraction of\nlight. Then the straight-line treatment of optics using rays fails. To explain phenomena\nsuch as diffraction, light is thought of as a wave, the details of which you will study\nin higher classes. Again, at the beginning of the 20th century, it became known that\nthe wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of\nlight with matter, and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles. This\nconfusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern\nquantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a ‘wave’ nor a ‘particle’ –\nthe new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature.\nIn this Chapter, we shall study the phenomena of reflection and\nrefraction of light using the straight-line propagation of light. These basic\nconcepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in\nnature. We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light\nby spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real\nlife situations.\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\n9.1 REFLECTION OF LIGHT\nA highly polished surface, such as a mirror, reflects most of the light\nfalling on it. You are already familiar with the laws of reflection of light.\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n135\nLet us recall these laws –\n(i)\nThe angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and\n(ii)\nThe incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence\nand the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane.\nThese laws of reflection are applicable to all types of reflecting surfaces\nincluding spherical surfaces. You are familiar with the formation of image\nby a plane mirror. What are the properties of the image? Image formed\nby a plane mirror is always virtual and erect.  The size of the image is\nequal to that of the object.  The image formed is as far behind the mirror\nas the object is in front of it.  Further, the image is laterally inverted.\nHow would the images be when the reflecting surfaces are curved? Let\nus explore.\nActivity 9.1\nActivity 9.1\nActivity 9.1\nActivity 9.1\nActivity 9.1\nn\nTake a large shining spoon. Try to view your face in its curved\nsurface.\nn\nDo you get the image?  Is it smaller or larger?\nn\nMove the spoon slowly away from your face. Observe the image.\nHow does it change?\nn\nReverse the spoon and repeat the Activity.  How does the image\nlook like now?\nn\nCompare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces.\nThe curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved\nmirror.  The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical\nmirror.  The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form\na part of the surface of a sphere.  Such mirrors, whose reflecting surfaces\nare spherical, are called spherical mirrors.  We shall now study about\nspherical mirrors in some detail.\n9.2 SPHERIC\n9.2 SPHERIC\n9.2 SPHERIC\n9.2 SPHERIC\n9.2 SPHERICAL MIRRORS\nAL MIRRORS\nAL MIRRORS\nAL MIRRORS\nAL MIRRORS\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or\noutwards.  A spherical mirror, whose reflecting surface is curved inwards,\nthat is, faces towards the centre of the sphere, is called a concave mirror.\nA spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards, is called\na convex mirror. The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown\nin Fig. 9.1. You may note in these diagrams that the back\nof the mirror is shaded.\nYou may now understand that the surface of the spoon\ncurved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror\nand the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be\napproximated to a convex mirror.\nBefore we move further on spherical mirrors, we need to\nrecognise and understand the meaning of a few terms. These\nterms are commonly used in discussions about spherical\nmirrors. The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical\nmirror is a point called the pole.  It lies on the surface of the\nmirror.  The pole is usually represented by the letter P.\nFigure 9.1\nFigure 9.1\nFigure 9.1\nFigure 9.1\nFigure 9.1\nSchematic representation of spherical\nmirrors; the shaded side is non-reflecting.\n(a) Concave mirror\n(b) Convex mirror\n2024-25\n\nScience\n136\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere.\nThis sphere has a centre. This point is called the centre of curvature of\nthe spherical mirror. It is represented by the letter C. Please note that the\ncentre of curvature is not a part of the mirror. It lies outside its reflecting\nsurface. The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it.\nHowever, it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror. You may\nnote this in Fig.9.2 (a) and (b). The radius of the sphere of which the\nreflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part, is called the radius\nof curvature of the mirror. It is represented by the letter R. You may note\nthat the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature. Imagine a straight\nline passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical\nmirror. This line is called the principal axis. Remember that principal\naxis is normal to the mirror at its pole. Let us understand an important\nterm related to mirrors, through an Activity.\nActivity 9.2\nActivity 9.2\nActivity 9.2\nActivity 9.2\nActivity 9.2\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or even into a mirror\nreflecting sunlight. It may damage your eyes.\nn\nHold a concave mirror in your hand and direct its reflecting surface\ntowards the Sun.\nn\nDirect the light reflected by the mirror on to a sheet of paper held\nclose to the mirror.\nn\nMove the sheet of paper back and forth gradually until you find\non the paper sheet a bright, sharp spot of light.\nn\nHold the mirror and the paper in the same position for a few\nminutes. What do you observe? Why?\nThe paper at first begins to burn producing smoke. Eventually it\nmay even catch fire. Why does it burn? The light from the Sun is converged\nat a point, as a sharp, bright spot by the mirror. In fact, this spot of light\nis the image of the Sun on the sheet of paper. This point is\nthe focus of the concave mirror. The heat produced due to\nthe concentration of sunlight ignites the paper. The distance\nof this image from the position of the mirror gives the\napproximate value of focal length of the mirror.\nLet us try to understand this observation with the help\nof a ray diagram.\nObserve Fig.9.2 (a) closely. A number of rays parallel\nto the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror. Observe\nthe reflected rays. They are all meeting/intersecting at a\npoint on the principal axis of the mirror.  This point is called\nthe principal focus of the concave mirror. Similarly, observe\nFig. 9.2 (b). How are the rays parallel to the principal axis,\nreflected by a convex mirror? The reflected rays appear to\ncome from a point on the principal axis. This point is called\nthe principal focus of the convex mirror. The principal focus\nis represented by the letter F. The distance between the\npole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called\nthe focal length. It is represented by the letter f.\nFigure 9.2\nFigure 9.2\nFigure 9.2\nFigure 9.2\nFigure 9.2\n(a) Concave mirror\n(b)     Convex mirror\n(b)\n(a)\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n137\nThe reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is by-and-large spherical.\nThe surface, then, has a circular outline. The diameter of the reflecting\nsurface of spherical mirror is called its aperture. In Fig.9.2, distance MN\nrepresents the aperture. We shall consider in our discussion only such\nspherical mirrors whose aperture is much smaller than its radius of\ncurvature.\nIs there a relationship between the radius of curvature R, and focal\nlength f, of a spherical mirror? For spherical mirrors of small apertures,\nthe radius of curvature is found to be equal to twice the focal length. We\nput this as R = 2f .  This implies that the principal focus of a spherical\nmirror lies midway between the pole and centre of curvature.\n9.2.1  Image Formation by Spherical Mirrors\nYou have studied about the image formation by plane mirrors. You also\nknow the nature, position and relative size of the images formed by them.\nHow about the images formed by spherical mirrors? How can we locate\nthe image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object?\nAre the images real or virtual? Are they enlarged, diminished or have\nthe same size? We shall explore this with an Activity.\nActivity 9.3\nActivity 9.3\nActivity 9.3\nActivity 9.3\nActivity 9.3\nYou have already learnt a way of determining the focal length of a\nconcave mirror. In Activity 9.2, you have seen that the sharp bright\nspot of light you got on the paper is, in fact, the image of the Sun. It\nwas a tiny, real, inverted image. You got the approximate focal length\nof the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from\nthe mirror.\nn\nTake a concave mirror.  Find out its approximate focal length in\nthe way described above. Note down the value of focal length. (You\ncan also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a\nsheet of paper.)\nn\nMark a line on a Table with a chalk.  Place the concave mirror on\na stand.  Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over\nthe line.\nn\nDraw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line\nsuch that the distance between any two successive lines is equal\nto the focal length of the mirror. These lines will now correspond\nto the positions of the points P, F and C, respectively. Remember –\nFor a spherical mirror of small aperture, the principal focus F lies\nmid-way between the pole P and the centre of curvature C.\nn\nKeep a bright object, say a burning candle, at a position far beyond\nC.  Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you\nobtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it.\nn\nObserve the image carefully.  Note down its nature, position and\nrelative size with respect to the object size.\nn\nRepeat the activity by placing the candle – (a) just beyond C,\n(b) at C, (c) between F and C, (d) at F, and (e) between P and F.\nn\nIn one of the cases, you may not get the image on the screen.\nIdentify the position of the object in such a case. Then, look for its\nvirtual image in the mirror itself.\nn Note down and tabulate your observations.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n138\nYou will see in the above Activity that the nature, position and size of\nthe image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the\nobject in relation to points P, F and C. The image formed is real for some\npositions of the object. It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other\nposition. The image is either magnified, reduced or has the same size,\ndepending on the position of the object. A summary of these observations\nis given for your reference in Table 9.1.\nTable 9.1 Image formation by a concave mirror for different positions of the object\nPosition of the\nPosition of the\nSize of the\nNature of the\nobject\nimage\nimage\nimage\nAt infinity\nAt the focus F\nHighly diminished,\nReal and inverted\npoint-sized\nBeyond C\nBetween F and C\nDiminished\nReal and inverted\nAt C\nAt C\nSame size\nReal and inverted\nBetween C and F\nBeyond C\nEnlarged\nReal and inverted\nAt F\nAt infinity\nHighly enlarged\nReal and inverted\nBetween P and F\nBehind the mirror\nEnlarged\nVirtual and erect\n9.2.2\nRepresentation of Images Formed by Spherical\nMirrors Using Ray Diagrams\nWe can also study the formation of images by spherical mirrors by\ndrawing ray diagrams. Consider an extended object, of finite size, placed\nin front of a spherical mirror. Each small portion of the extended object\nacts like a point source. An infinite number of rays originate from each\nof these points. To construct the ray diagrams, in order to locate the\nimage of an object, an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a\npoint could be considered.  However, it is more convenient to consider\nonly two rays, for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram. These rays are\nso chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the\nmirror.\nThe intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image\nof the point object.  Any two of the following rays can be considered for\nlocating the image.\n(i)\nA ray parallel to the principal\naxis, after reflection, will pass\nthrough the principal focus\nin case of a concave mirror\nor appear to diverge from\nthe principal focus in\ncase of a convex mirror.\nThis is illustrated in Fig.9.3\n(a) and (b).\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure\nFigure\nFigure\nFigure\nFigure 9.3\n9.3\n9.3\n9.3\n9.3\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n139\n(ii)\nA ray passing through the\nprincipal focus of a concave\nmirror or a ray which is\ndirected \ntowards \nthe\nprincipal focus of a convex\nmirror, after reflection, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.4 (a)\nand (b).\n(iii)\nA ray passing through the\ncentre of curvature of a\nconcave mirror or directed\nin the direction of the centre\nof curvature of a convex\nmirror, after reflection, is\nreflected back along the\nsame path.  This is\nillustrated in Fig.9.5 (a) and\n(b). The light rays come back\nalong the same path\nbecause the incident rays\nfall on the mirror along the\nnormal to the reflecting\nsurface.\n(iv)\nA ray incident obliquely to\nthe principal axis, towards\na point P (pole of the mirror),\non the concave mirror\n[Fig. 9.6 (a)] or a convex\nmirror [Fig. 9.6 (b)], is\nreflected obliquely. The\nincident and reflected rays\nfollow the laws of reflection\nat the point of incidence\n(point P), making equal\nangles with the principal axis.\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 9.4\nFigure 9.4\nFigure 9.4\nFigure 9.4\nFigure 9.4\nRemember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed.\nAt the point of incidence, the incident ray is reflected in such a way that\nthe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.\n(a)\nImage formation by Concave Mirror\nFigure 9.7 illustrates the ray diagrams for the formation of image\nby a concave mirror for various positions of the object.\n(b)\n(a)\nFigure 9.5\nFigure 9.5\nFigure 9.5\nFigure 9.5\nFigure 9.5\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 9.6\nFigure 9.6\nFigure 9.6\nFigure 9.6\nFigure 9.6\n2024-25\n\nScience\n140\nFigure 9.7\nFigure 9.7\nFigure 9.7\nFigure 9.7\nFigure 9.7 Ray diagrams for the image formation by a concave mirror\nActivity 9.4\nActivity 9.4\nActivity 9.4\nActivity 9.4\nActivity 9.4\nn\nDraw neat ray diagrams for each position of the object shown in\nTable 9.1.\nn\nYou may take any two of the rays mentioned in the previous section\nfor locating the image.\nn\nCompare your diagram with those given in Fig. 9.7.\nn\nDescribe the nature, position and relative size of the image formed\nin each case.\nn\nTabulate the results in a convenient format.\nUses of concave mirrors\nConcave mirrors are commonly used in torches, search-lights and\nvehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light. They are\noften used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face. The\ndentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients.\nLarge concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce\nheat in solar furnaces.\n(b)\nImage formation by a Convex Mirror\nWe studied the image formation by a concave mirror. Now we shall\nstudy the formation of image by a convex mirror.\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n141\nWe consider two positions of the object for studying the image formed\nby a convex mirror.  First is when the object is at infinity and the second\nposition is when the object is at a finite distance from the mirror. The ray\ndiagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these two\npositions of the object are shown in Fig.9.8 (a) and (b), respectively.  The\nresults are summarised in Table 9.2.\nActivity 9.5\nActivity 9.5\nActivity 9.5\nActivity 9.5\nActivity 9.5\nn\nTake a convex mirror.  Hold it in one hand.\nn\nHold a pencil in the upright position in the other hand.\nn\nObserve the image of the pencil in the mirror. Is the image erect or\ninverted?  Is it diminished or enlarged?\nn\nMove the pencil away from the mirror slowly. Does the image\nbecome smaller or larger?\nn\nRepeat this Activity carefully.  State whether the image will move\ncloser to or farther away from the focus as the object is moved\naway from the mirror?\nFigure 9.8 \nFigure 9.8 \nFigure 9.8 \nFigure 9.8 \nFigure 9.8 Formation of image by a convex mirror\nYou have so far studied the image formation by a plane mirror, a\nconcave mirror and a convex mirror.

Did you see the entire\nobject in the image?\nn\nRepeat this Activity with a concave mirror.  Did the mirror show\nfull length image of the object?\nn\nNow try using a convex mirror. Did you succeed? Explain your\nobservations with reason.\nYou can see a full-length image of a tall building/tree in a small\nconvex mirror. One such mirror is fitted in a wall of Agra Fort facing Taj\nMahal. If you visit the Agra Fort, try to observe the full image of Taj\nMahal. To view distinctly, you should stand suitably at the terrace\nadjoining the wall.\nUses of convex mirrors\nConvex mirrors are commonly used as rear-view (wing) mirrors in\nvehicles. These mirrors are fitted on the sides of the vehicle, enabling the\ndriver to see traffic behind him/her to facilitate safe driving. Convex\nmirrors are preferred because they always give an erect, though\ndiminished, image. Also, they have a wider field of view as they are curved\noutwards. Thus, convex mirrors enable the driver to view much larger\narea than would be possible with a plane mirror.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nDefine the principal focus of a concave mirror.\n2.\nThe radius of curvature of a spherical mirror is 20 cm.  What is its focal\nlength?\n3.\nName a mirror that can give an erect and enlarged image of an object.\n4.\nWhy do we prefer a convex mirror as a rear-view mirror in vehicles?\n9.2.3 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors\nWhile dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors, we shall\nfollow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention. In this convention, the pole (P) of the mirror is taken as the\norigin (Fig. 9.9).  The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the x-axis\n(X’X) of the coordinate system. The conventions are as follows –\n(i)\nThe object is always placed to the left of the mirror. This implies\nthat the light from the object falls on the mirror from the left-hand\nside.\n(ii)\nAll distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the\npole of the mirror.\n(iii)\nAll the distances measured to the right of the origin (along\n+ x-axis) are taken as positive while those measured to the left of\nthe origin (along – x-axis) are taken as negative.\n(iv)\nDistances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis\n(along + y-axis) are taken as positive.\n(v)\nDistances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis\n(along –y-axis) are taken as negative.\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n143\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in\nFig.9.9 for your reference. These sign conventions are applied to obtain\nthe mirror formula and solve related numerical problems.\n9.2.4  Mirror Formula and  Magnification\nIn a spherical mirror, the distance of the\nobject from its pole is called the object\ndistance (u).  The distance of the image from\nthe pole of the mirror is called the image\ndistance (v). You already know that the\ndistance of the principal focus from the pole\nis called the focal length (f). There is a\nrelationship between these three quantities\ngiven by the mirror formula which is\nexpressed as\n1\n1\n1\nv\nu\nf\n+\n=\n(9.1)\nThis formula is valid in all situations for all\nspherical mirrors for all positions of the\nobject. You must use the New Cartesian Sign\nConvention while substituting numerical\nvalues for u, v, f, and R in the mirror formula\nfor solving problems.\nMagnification\nMagnification produced by a spherical mirror gives the relative extent to\nwhich the image of an object is magnified with respect to the object size.\nIt is expressed as the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the\nobject. It is usually represented by the letter m.\nIf h is the height of the object and h′ is the height of the image, then\nthe magnification m produced by a spherical mirror is given by\nm = \nHeight of the image (\n)\nHeight of the object ( )\n′\nh\nh\nm = \n′\nh\nh\n(9.2)\nThe magnification m is also related to the object distance (u) and\nimage distance (v).  It can be expressed as:\nMagnification (m)  = \n′ = −\nh\nh\nv\nu\n(9.3)\nYou may note that the height of the object is taken to be positive as\nthe object is usually placed above the principal axis.  The height of the\nimage should be taken as positive for virtual images.  However, it is to be\ntaken as negative for real images. A negative sign in the value of the\nmagnification indicates that the image is real. A positive sign in the value\nof the magnification indicates that the image is virtual.\nFigure 9.9\nFigure 9.9\nFigure 9.9\nFigure 9.9\nFigure 9.9\nThe New Cartesian Sign Convention for spherical mirrors\n2024-25\n\nScience\n144\nExample 9.1\nA convex mirror used for rear-view on an automobile has a radius of\ncurvature of 3.00 m.

Does it still move along a straight-line path or change its\ndirection? We shall recall some of our day-to-day experiences.\nYou might have observed that the bottom of a tank or a pond\ncontaining water appears to be raised. Similarly, when a thick glass slab\nis placed over some printed matter, the letters appear raised when viewed\nthrough the glass slab. Why does it happen? Have you seen a pencil\npartly immersed in water in a glass tumbler? It appears to be displaced\nat the interface of air and water. You might have observed that a lemon\nkept in water in a glass tumbler appears to be bigger than its actual\nsize, when viewed from the sides. How can you account for such\nexperiences?\nLet us consider the case of the apparent displacement of a pencil,\npartly immersed in water. The light reaching you from the portion of the\npencil inside water seems to come from a different direction, compared\nto the part above water. This makes the pencil appear to be displaced at\nthe interface. For similar reasons, the letters appear to be raised, when\nseen through a glass slab placed over it.\nDoes a pencil appear to be displaced to the same extent, if instead of\nwater, we use liquids like kerosene or turpentine? Will the letters appear\nto rise to the same height if we replace a glass slab with a transparent\nplastic slab? You will find that the extent of the effect is different for\ndifferent pair of media. These observations indicate that light does not\n2024-25\n\nScience\n146\ntravel in the same direction in all media. It appears that when travelling\nobliquely from one medium to another, the direction of propagation of\nlight in the second medium changes. This phenomenon is known as\nrefraction of light. Let us understand this phenomenon further by doing\na few activities.\nActivity 9.7\nActivity 9.7\nActivity 9.7\nActivity 9.7\nActivity 9.7\nn\nPlace a coin at the bottom of a bucket filled with water.\nn\nWith your eye to a side above water, try to pick up the coin in one\ngo.

Does the coin becomes\nvisible again from your position?  How could this happen?\nThe coin becomes visible again on pouring water into the bowl. The\ncoin appears slightly raised above its actual position due to refraction of\nlight.\nActivity 9.9\nActivity 9.9\nActivity 9.9\nActivity 9.9\nActivity 9.9\nn\nDraw a thick straight line in ink, over a sheet of white paper placed\non a Table.\nn\nPlace a glass slab over the line in such a way that one of its edges\nmakes an angle with the line.\nn\nLook at the portion of the line under the slab from the sides. What\ndo you observe? Does the line under the glass slab appear to be\nbent at the edges?\nn\nNext, place the glass slab such that it is normal to the line. What\ndo you observe now? Does the part of the line under the glass slab\nappear bent?\nn\nLook at the line from the top of the glass slab. Does the part of the\nline, beneath the slab, appear to be raised? Why does this happen?\n9.3.1 Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab\nTo understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through a glass\nslab, let us do an Activity.\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n147\nIn this Activity, you will note, the light ray has changed its direction\nat points O and O′. Note that both the points O and O′ lie on surfaces\nseparating two transparent media. Draw a perpendicular NN’ to AB at O\nand another perpendicular MM′ to CD at O′. The light ray at point O has\nentered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to\nglass. Note that the light ray has bent towards\nthe normal. At O′, the light ray has entered\nfrom glass to air, that is, from a denser\nmedium to a rarer medium.  The light here\nhas bent away from the normal. Compare the\nangle of incidence with the angle of refraction\nat both refracting surfaces AB and CD.\nIn Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely\nincident on surface AB, called incident ray.\nOO′ is the refracted ray and O′ H is the\nemergent ray. You may observe that the\nemergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nthe incident ray. Why does it happen so? The\nextent of bending of the ray of light at the\nopposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)\nand CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular\nglass slab is equal and opposite. This is why\nthe ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.\nHowever, the light ray is shifted sideward\nslightly. What happens when a light ray is\nincident normally to the interface of two\nmedia? Try and find out.\nNow you are familiar with the refraction of light. Refraction is due to\nchange in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to\nanother.  Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to\ncertain laws.\nActivity 9.10\nActivity 9.10\nActivity 9.10\nActivity 9.10\nActivity 9.10\nn\nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\nn\nPlace a rectangular glass slab over the sheet in the middle.\nn\nDraw the outline of the slab with a pencil.

Let EF meet AB at O.  Similarly, join the positions of tip\nof the pins G and H and produce it up to the edge CD.  Let HG\nmeet CD at O′.\nn\nJoin O and O′.  Also produce EF up to P, as shown by a dotted line\nin Fig. 9.10.\nFigure 9.10\nFigure 9.10\nFigure 9.10\nFigure 9.10\nFigure 9.10\nRefraction of light through a rectangular glass slab\n2024-25\n\nScience\n148\nThe following are the laws of refraction of light.\n (i)\nThe incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface\nof two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the\nsame plane.\n(ii)\nThe ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of\nrefraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for\nthe given pair of media. This law is also known as Snell’s law of\nrefraction. (This is true for angle 0 < i < 90o)\nIf i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,\nsin\nsin\ni\nr  = constant\n(9.4)\nThis constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium\nwith respect to the first.  Let us study about refractive index in some detail.\n9.3.2 The Refractive Index\nYou have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from\none transparent medium into another will change its direction in the\nsecond medium. The extent of the change in direction that takes place\nin a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,\nthe “constant” appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).\nThe refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,\nthe relative speed of propagation of light in different media. It turns\nout that light propagates with different speeds in different media. Light\ntravels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3×108 m s–1.  In air, the speed of\nlight is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum. It reduces\nconsiderably in glass or water. The value of the refractive index for a\ngiven pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as\ngiven below.\nConsider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as\nshown in Fig.9.11.  Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the\nspeed of light in medium 2.  The refractive index of medium 2 with respect\nto medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and\nthe speed of light in medium 2. This is usually represented by the symbol\nn21. This can be expressed in an equation form as\nn21= Speed of light in medium 1 \nSpeed of light in medium 2 = v\nv\n1\n2\n(9.5)\nBy the same argument, the refractive index of medium\n1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12. It is given\nby\nn12= Speed of light in medium 2 \nSpeed of light in medium 1 = v\nv\n2\n1\n(9.6)\nIf medium 1 is vacuum or air, then the refractive index of medium 2\nis considered with respect to vacuum.  This is called the absolute refractive\nindex of the medium.  It is simply represented as n2. If c is the speed of\nFigure 9.11\nFigure 9.11\nFigure 9.11\nFigure 9.11\nFigure 9.11\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n149\nThe ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density.\nOptical density has a definite connotation.  It is not the same as mass density. We have\nbeen using the terms ‘rarer medium’ and ‘denser medium’ in this Chapter. It actually\nmeans  ‘optically rarer medium’ and ‘optically denser medium’, respectively. When can\nwe say that a medium is optically denser than the other? In comparing two media, the\none with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other.  The other\nmedium of lower refractive index is optically rarer.  The speed of light is higher in a rarer\nmedium than a denser medium. Thus, a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a\ndenser medium slows down and bends  towards the normal. When it travels from a\ndenser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.\nNote from Table 9.3 that an optically denser medium may not possess\ngreater mass density. For example, kerosene having higher refractive\nindex, is optically denser than water, although its mass density is less\nthan water.\nMaterial\nRefractive\nMaterial\nRefractive\nmedium\nindex\nmedium\nindex\nAir\n1.0003\nCanada\n1.53\nBalsam\nIce\n1.31\nWater\n1.33\nRock salt\n1.54\nAlcohol\n1.36\nKerosene\n1.44\nCarbon\n1.63\ndisulphide\nFused\n1.46\nquartz\nDense\n1.65\nflint glass\nTurpentine\n1.47\noil\nRuby\n1.71\nBenzene\n1.50\nSapphire\n1.77\nCrown\n1.52\nglass\nDiamond\n 2.42\nlight in air and v is the speed of light in the medium, then, the refractive\nindex of the medium nm is given by\nnm = \nSpeed of light in air \nSpeed of light in the medium = c\nv\n(9.7)\nThe absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive\nindex. The refractive index of several media is given in Table 9.3. From\nthe Table you can know that the refractive index of water, nw = 1.33.\nThis means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of\nlight in water is equal to 1.33.  Similarly, the refractive index of crown\nglass, ng =1.52. Such data are helpful in many places.  However, you\nneed not memorise the data.\nTable 9.3 Absolute refractive index of some material media\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\nScience\n150\n9.3.3 Refraction by Spherical Lenses\nYou might have seen watchmakers using a small magnifying glass to\nsee tiny parts. Have you ever touched the surface of a magnifying glass\nwith your hand? Is it plane surface or curved? Is it thicker in the middle\nor at the edges? The glasses used in spectacles and that by a watchmaker\nare examples of lenses. What is a lens? How does it bend light rays? We\nshall discuss these in this section.\nA transparent material bound by two surfaces, of which one or both\nsurfaces are spherical, forms a lens. This means\nthat a lens is bound by at least one spherical\nsurface. In such lenses, the other surface would\nbe plane.  A lens may have two spherical\nsurfaces, bulging outwards. Such a lens is called\na double convex lens. It is simply called a convex\nlens. It is thicker at the middle as compared to\nthe edges. Convex lens converges light rays as\nshown in Fig. 9.12 (a). Hence convex lenses are\nalso called converging lenses.  Similarly, a double\nconcave lens is bounded by two spherical\nsurfaces, curved inwards.  It is thicker at the\nedges than at the middle. Such lenses diverge\nlight rays as shown in Fig. 9.12 (b). Such lenses\nare also called diverging lenses. A double concave\nlens is simply called a concave lens.\nA lens, either a convex lens or a concave lens,\nhas two spherical surfaces. Each of these surfaces\nforms a part of a sphere. The centres of these\nspheres are called centres of curvature of the lens.\nThe centre of curvature of a lens is usually\nrepresented by the letter C.  Since there are two\ncentres of curvature, we may represent them as C1 and C2. An imaginary\nstraight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is\ncalled its principal axis. The central point of a lens is its optical centre. It is\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nA ray of light travelling in air enters obliquely into water. Does the light\nray bend towards the normal or away from the normal? Why?\n2.\nLight enters from air to glass having refractive index 1.50. What is the\nspeed of light in the glass? The speed of light in vacuum is 3 × 108 m s–1.\n3.\nFind out, from Table 9.3, the medium having highest optical density.\nAlso find the medium with lowest optical density.\n4.\nYou are given kerosene, turpentine and water. In which of these does\nthe light travel fastest? Use the information given in Table 9.3.\n5.\nThe refractive index of diamond is 2.42. What is the meaning of this\nstatement?\n(a)\nFigure 9.12\nFigure 9.12\nFigure 9.12\nFigure 9.12\nFigure 9.12\n(a) Converging action of a convex lens, (b) diverging\naction of a concave lens\n(b)\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n151\nusually represented by the letter O. A ray of light through the optical\ncentre of a lens passes without suffering any deviation. The effective\ndiameter of the circular outline of a spherical lens is called its aperture.\nWe shall confine our discussion in this Chapter to such lenses whose\naperture is much less than its radius of curvature and the two centres of\ncurvatures are equidistant from the optical centre O. Such lenses are\ncalled thin lenses with small apertures. What happens when parallel rays\nof light are incident on a lens?  Let us do an Activity to understand this.\nActivity 9.11\nActivity 9.11\nActivity 9.11\nActivity 9.11\nActivity 9.11\nCAUTION: Do not look at the Sun directly or through a lens while\ndoing this Activity or otherwise. You may damage your eyes if you\ndo so.\nn\nHold a convex lens in your hand. Direct it towards the Sun.\nn\nFocus the light from the Sun on a sheet of paper. Obtain a sharp\nbright image of the Sun.\nn\nHold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while.  Keep\nobserving the paper. What happened? Why? Recall your experience\nin Activity 9.2.\nThe paper begins to burn producing smoke. It may even catch fire\nafter a while.  Why does this happen? The light from the Sun constitutes\nparallel rays of light.  These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp\nbright spot formed on the paper.  In fact, the bright spot you got on the\npaper is a real image of the Sun. The concentration of the sunlight at a\npoint generated heat.  This caused the paper to burn.\nNow, we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a\nlens.  What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens?\nThis is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig.9.12 (a) and for a concave lens\nin Fig.9.12 (b).\nObserve Fig.9.12 (a) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a convex lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are converging to a point on the principal axis. This point\non the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens. Let us see\nnow the action of a concave lens.\nObserve Fig.9.12 (b) carefully. Several rays of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis are falling on a concave lens. These rays, after refraction\nfrom the lens, are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal\naxis. This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the\nconcave lens.\nIf you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens, you\nget another principal focus on the opposite side. Letter F is usually used\nto represent principal focus. However, a lens has two principal foci.  They\nare represented by F1 and F2. The distance of the principal focus from\nthe optical centre of a lens is called its focal length. The letter f  is used to\nrepresent the focal length. How can you find the focal length of a convex\nlens? Recall the Activity 9.11. In this Activity, the distance between the\nposition of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the\napproximate focal length of the lens.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n152\n9.3.4 Image Formation by Lenses\nLenses form images by refracting light.

Note down and tabulate your\nobservations.\nThe nature, position and relative size of the image formed by convex\nlens for various positions of the object is summarised in Table 9.4.\nLet us now do an Activity to study the nature, position and relative\nsize of the image formed by a concave lens.\nTable 9.4 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a convex lens for various\npositions of the object\nPosition of the\nPosition of\nRelative size of\nNature of\nobject\nthe image\n the image\nthe image\nAt infinity\nAt focus F2\nHighly diminished,\nReal and inverted\npoint-sized\nBeyond 2F1\nBetween F2  and 2F2\nDiminished\nReal and inverted\nAt 2F1\nAt 2F2\nSame size\nReal and inverted\nBetween F1 and 2F1\nBeyond 2F2\nEnlarged\nReal and inverted\nAt focus F1\nAt infinity\nInfinitely large or\nReal and inverted\nhighly enlarged\nBetween focus F1\nOn the same side\nEnlarged\nVirtual and erect\nand\nof the lens as the\noptical centre O\nobject\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n153\nThe summary of the above Activity is given in Table 9.5 below.\nActivity 9.13\nActivity 9.13\nActivity 9.13\nActivity 9.13\nActivity 9.13\nn\nTake a concave lens. Place it on a lens stand.\nn\nPlace a burning candle on one side of the lens.\nn\nLook through the lens from the other side and observe the image.\nTry to get the image on a screen, if possible. If not, observe the\nimage directly through the lens.\nn\nNote down the nature, relative size and approximate position of\nthe image.\nn\nMove the candle away from the lens.  Note the change in the size\nof the image. What happens to the size of the image when the\ncandle is placed too far away from the lens.\nWhat conclusion can you draw from this Activity? A concave lens\nwill always give a virtual, erect and diminished image, irrespective of the\nposition of the object.\n9.3.5 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams\n We can represent image formation by lenses using ray diagrams. Ray\ndiagrams will also help us to study the nature, position and relative size\nof the image formed by lenses. For drawing ray diagrams in lenses, alike\nof spherical mirrors, we consider any two of the following rays –\n(i)\nA ray of light from the object, parallel to the principal axis, after\nrefraction from a convex lens, passes through the principal focus\non the other side of the lens, as shown in Fig. 9.13 (a). In case of\na concave lens,\nthe ray appears\nto diverge from\nthe principal\nfocus located\non the same\nside of the lens,\nas shown in\nFig. 9.13 (b).\n(a)\n(b)\nTable 9.5 Nature, position and relative size of the image formed by a concave lens for various\npositions of the object\nPosition of the\nPosition of\nRelative size of\nNature of\nobject\nthe image\n the image\nthe image\nAt infinity\nAt focus F1\nHighly diminished,\nVirtual and erect\npoint-sized\nBetween infinity and\nBetween focus F1\nDiminished\nVirtual and erect\noptical centre O\nand optical centre O\nof the lens\nFigure 9.13\nFigure 9.13\nFigure 9.13\nFigure 9.13\nFigure 9.13\n2024-25\n\nScience\n154\n(ii)\nA ray of light passing\nthrough a principal\nfocus, after refraction\nfrom a convex lens, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig. 9.14 (a). A\nray of light appearing to\nmeet at the principal\nfocus of a concave lens,\nafter refraction, will\nemerge parallel to the\nprincipal axis. This is\nshown in Fig.9.14 (b).\n(iii)\nA ray of light passing\nthrough the optical\ncentre of a lens will\nemerge without any\ndeviation. \nThis \nis\nillustrated in Fig.9.15(a)\nand Fig.9.15 (b).\n(b)\n(a)\n(b)\n(a)\nThe ray diagrams for the image formation in a convex lens for a few\npositions of the object are shown in Fig. 9.16.

We apply the rules for signs of distances, except that all\nmeasurements are taken from the optical centre of the lens. According\nto the convention, the focal length of a convex lens is positive and that of\na concave lens is negative. You must take care to apply appropriate\nsigns for the values of u, v, f, object height h and image height h′.\n9.3.7 Lens Formula and Magnification\nAs we have a formula for spherical mirrors, we also have formula for\nspherical lenses. This formula gives the relationship between object-\ndistance (u), image-distance (v) and the focal length (f ).  The lens formula\nis expressed as\n1\n1\n1\nv\nu\nf\n−\n=\n(9.8)\nThe lens formula given above is general and is valid in all situations\nfor any spherical lens. Take proper care of the signs of different quantities,\nwhile putting numerical values for solving problems relating to lenses.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n156\nMagnification\nThe magnification produced by a lens, similar to that for spherical\nmirrors, is defined as the ratio of the height of the image and the height\nof the object. Magnification is represented by the letter m. If h is the\nheight of the object and h′ is the height of the image given by a lens, then\nthe magnification produced by the lens is given by,\nm = Height of the Image\nHeight of the object = h\nh\n′\n(9.9)\nMagnification produced by a lens is also related to the object-distance\nu, and the image-distance v. This relationship is given by\nMagnification (m ) = h′/h = v/u\n(9.10)\nExample 9.3\nA concave lens has focal length of 15 cm. At what distance should\nthe object from the lens be placed so that it forms an image at 10 cm\nfrom the lens? Also, find the magnification produced by the lens.\nSolution\nA concave lens always forms a virtual, erect image on the same side\nof the object.\nImage-distance v\n= –10 cm;\nFocal length f\n= –15 cm;\nObject-distance u\n= ?\nSince 1\n1\n1\nv\nu\nf\n−\n=\nor,\n1\n1\n1\n–\nu\nv\nf\n=\n(\n)\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n–\n–\n–10\n–15\n10\n15\nu =\n=\n+\n1\n3\n2\n1\n30\n30\nu\n−\n+\n=\n= −\nor,  u = – 30 cm\nThus, the object-distance is 30 cm.\nMagnification m = v/u\nm = −\n−\n=\n+\n10cm\n30cm\n1\n3\n0.33\n;\nThe positive sign shows that the image is erect and virtual. The image\nis one-third of the size of the object.\nExample 9.4\nA 2.0 cm tall object is placed perpendicular to the principal axis of a\nconvex lens of focal length 10 cm. The distance of the object from the\nlens is 15 cm. Find the nature, position and size of the image. Also\nfind its magnification.\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n157\nSolution\nHeight of the object h\n= + 2.0 cm;\nFocal length f\n= + 10 cm;\nobject-distance u\n= –15 cm;\nImage-distance v\n= ?\nHeight of the image h′ = ?\nSince\n1\n1\n1\nv\nu\nf\n−\n=\nor,\n1\n1\n1\nv\nu\nf\n=\n+\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n( 15)\n10\n15\n10\nv =\n+\n= −\n+\n−\n1\n2\n3\n1\n30\n30\nv\n−\n+\n=\n=\nor,\nv = + 30 cm\nThe positive sign of v shows that the image is formed at a distance of\n30 cm on the other side of the optical centre.  The image is real and\ninverted.\nMagnification m = \n'\nh\nv\nh\nu\n=\nor,\nh′ = h (v/u)\nHeight of the image, h′ = (2.0) (+30/–15) = – 4.0 cm\nMagnification m =  v/u\nor, \n30cm\n2\n15cm\nm\n+\n=\n= −\n−\nThe negative signs of m and h′ show that the image is inverted and\nreal. It is formed below the principal axis. Thus, a real, inverted image,\n4 cm tall, is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the\nlens. The image is two times enlarged.\n9.3.8 Power of a Lens\nYou have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge\nlight rays depends on its focal length. For example, a convex lens of\nshort focal length bends the light rays through large angles, by focussing\nthem closer to the optical centre. Similarly, concave lens of very short\nfocal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal\nlength. The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved\nby a lens is expressed in terms of its power. The power of a lens is defined\nas the reciprocal of its focal length. It is represented by the letter P.  The\npower P of a lens of focal length f is given by\nP = \n1\nf\n(9.11)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n158\nThe SI unit of power of a lens is ‘dioptre’. It is denoted by the letter D.\nIf f is expressed in metres, then, power is expressed in dioptres. Thus,\n1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre. 1D = 1m–1.\nYou may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a\nconcave lens is negative.\nOpticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers.  Let us\nsay the lens prescribed has power equal to + 2.0 D.  This means the lens\nprescribed is convex.  The focal length of the lens is + 0.50 m. Similarly,\na lens of power – 2.5 D has a focal length of – 0.40 m.  The lens is concave.\nMany optical instruments consist of a number of lenses. They are combined to increase\nthe magnification and sharpness of the image. The net power (P ) of the lenses placed\nin contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1, P2, P3, …   as\nP = P1 + P2 + P3 + …\nThe use of powers, instead of focal lengths, for lenses is quite convenient for opticians.\nDuring eye-testing, an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses\nof known power, in contact, inside the testing spectacles’ frame. The optician calculates\nthe power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition. For example, a combination\nof two lenses of power  + 2.0 D and + 0.25 D is equivalent to a single lens of power + 2.25 D.\nThe simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems\nto minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens.  Such a lens system,\nconsisting of several lenses, in contact, is commonly used in the design of lenses of\ncamera, microscopes and telescopes.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nDefine 1 dioptre of power of a lens.\n2.\nA convex lens forms a real and inverted image of a needle at a distance\nof 50 cm from it.  Where is the needle placed in front of the convex lens\nif the image is equal to the size of the object? Also, find the power of the\nlens.\n3.\nFind the power of a concave lens of focal length 2 m.\nWhat you have learnt\nn\nLight seems to travel in straight lines.\nn\nMirrors and lenses form images of objects. Images can be either real or virtual,\ndepending on the position of the object.\nn\nThe reflecting surfaces, of all types, obey the laws of reflection. The refracting\nsurfaces obey the laws of refraction.\nn\nNew Cartesian Sign Conventions are followed for spherical mirrors and lenses.\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\nLight – Reflection and Refraction\n159\nn\nMirror formula, \n1\n1\n1\n+\n=\nv\nu\nf , gives the relationship between the object-distance (u),\nimage-distance (v), and focal length (f) of a spherical mirror.\nn\nThe focal length of a spherical mirror is equal to half its radius of curvature.\nn\nThe magnification produced by a spherical mirror is the ratio of the height of the\nimage to the height of the object.\nn\nA light ray travelling obliquely from a denser medium to a rarer medium bends\naway from the normal. A light ray bends towards the normal when it travels obliquely\nfrom a rarer to a denser medium.\nn\nLight travels in vacuum with an enormous speed of 3×108 m s-1.  The speed of light\nis different in different media.\nn\nThe refractive index of a transparent medium is the ratio of the speed of light in\nvacuum to that in the medium.\nn\nIn case of a rectangular glass slab, the refraction takes place at both air-glass\ninterface and glass-air interface. The emergent ray is parallel to the direction of\nincident ray.\nn\nLens formula, \n1\n1\n1\n–\n=\nv\nu\nf , gives the relationship between the object-distance (u),\nimage-distance (v), and the focal length (f) of a spherical lens.\nn\nPower of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length.

    "jesc110": "The Human Eye and\nthe Colourful World\n10\nCHAPTER\nY\nou have studied in the previous chapter about refraction of light by\nlenses. You also studied the nature, position and relative size of\nimages formed by lenses. How can these ideas help us in the study of\nthe human eye? The human eye uses light and enables us to see objects\naround us. It has a lens in its structure.  What is the function of the lens\nin a human eye? How do the lenses used in spectacles correct defects of\nvision? Let us consider these questions in this chapter.\nWe have learnt in the previous chapter about light and some of its\nproperties. In this chapter, we shall use these ideas to study some of the\noptical phenomena in nature. We shall also discuss about rainbow\nformation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.\n10.1 THE HUMAN EYE\nThe human eye is one of the most valuable and sensitive sense organs.\nIt enables us to see the wonderful world and the colours around us. On\nclosing the eyes, we can identify objects to some extent by their smell,\ntaste, sound they make or by touch. It is, however, impossible to identify\ncolours while closing the eyes. Thus, of all the sense organs, the human\neye is the most significant one as it enables us to see the beautiful,\ncolourful world around us.\nThe human eye is like a camera.  Its lens\nsystem forms an image on a light-sensitive\nscreen called the retina. Light enters the eye\nthrough a thin membrane called the cornea.\nIt forms the transparent bulge on the front\nsurface of the eyeball as shown in Fig. 10.1.\nThe eyeball is approximately spherical in shape\nwith a diameter of about 2.3 cm. Most of the\nrefraction for the light rays entering the eye\noccurs at the outer surface of the cornea. The\ncrystalline lens merely provides the finer\nadjustment of focal length required to focus\nobjects at different distances on the retina. We find a structure called iris\nbehind the cornea. Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the\nsize of the pupil.  The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light\nFigure 10.1\nFigure 10.1\nFigure 10.1\nFigure 10.1\nFigure 10.1\nThe human eye\n2024-25\n\nScience\n162\nentering the eye. The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object\non the retina. The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous\nnumber of light-sensitive cells.  The light-sensitive cells get activated\nupon illumination and generate electrical signals.  These signals are\nsent to the brain via the optic nerves.  The brain interprets these signals,\nand finally, processes the information so that we perceive objects as\nthey are.\n10.1.1 Power of Accommodation\nThe eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature\ncan be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. The change in the\ncurvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length. When the\nmuscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length\nincreases.  This enables us to see distant objects clearly. When you are\nlooking at objects closer to the eye, the ciliary muscles contract. This\nincreases the curvature of the eye lens. The eye lens then becomes thicker.\nConsequently, the focal length of the eye lens decreases.  This enables\nus to see nearby objects clearly.\nThe ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called\naccommodation.  However, the focal length of the eye lens cannot be\ndecreased below a certain minimum limit.  Try to read a printed page by\nholding it very close to your eyes. You may see the image being blurred\nor feel strain in the eye. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you\nmust hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes.  The minimum distance, at\nwhich objects can be seen most distinctly without strain, is called the\nleast distance of distinct vision. It is also called the near point of the eye.\nFor a young adult with normal vision, the near point is about\n25 cm. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is\ncalled the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a normal eye. You may note\nhere a normal eye can see objects clearly that are between 25 cm and\ninfinity.\nSometimes, the crystalline lens of people at old age becomes milky and\ncloudy. This condition is called cataract. This causes partial or complete\nloss of vision. It is possible to restore vision through a cataract surgery.\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\n10.2 DEFECTS OF VISION AND THEIR CORRECTION\nSometimes, the eye may gradually lose its power of accommodation.\nIn such conditions, the person cannot see the objects distinctly and\ncomfortably. The vision becomes blurred due to the refractive defects\nof the eye.\nThere are mainly three common refractive defects of vision. These\nare (i) myopia or near-sightedness, (ii) Hypermetropia or far-\nsightedness, and (iii) Presbyopia.  These defects can be corrected by\nthe use of suitable spherical lenses. We discuss below these defects\nand their correction.\n2024-25\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n163\n(a)\nMyopia\nMyopia is also known as near-\nsightedness. A person with myopia\ncan see nearby objects clearly but\ncannot see distant objects distinctly.\nA person with this defect has the far\npoint nearer than infinity. Such a\nperson may see clearly upto a\ndistance of a few metres. In a myopic\neye, the image of a distant object is\nformed in front of the retina [Fig.\n10.2 (b)] and not at the retina itself.\nThis defect may arise due to (i)\nexcessive curvature of the eye lens,\nor (ii) elongation of the eyeball. This\ndefect can be corrected by using a\nconcave lens of suitable power. This\nis illustrated in Fig. 10.2 (c). A\nconcave lens of suitable power will\nbring the image back on to the\nretina and thus the defect is corrected.\n(b)\nHypermetropia\nHypermetropia is also known as far-sightedness.\nA person with hypermetropia can see distant\nobjects clearly but cannot see nearby objects\ndistinctly. The near point, for the person, is farther\naway from the normal near point (25 cm). Such a\nperson has to keep a reading material much\nbeyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable\nreading. This is because the light rays from a\ncloseby object are focussed at a point behind the\nretina as shown in Fig. 10.3 (b). This defect arises\neither because (i) the focal length of the eye lens is\ntoo long, or (ii) the eyeball has become too small.\nThis defect can be corrected by using a convex\nlens of appropriate power. This is illustrated in\nFig. 10.3 (c). Eye-glasses with converging lenses\nprovide the additional focussing power required\nfor forming the image on the retina.\n(c)   Presbyopia\nThe power of accommodation of the eye usually\ndecreases with ageing. For most people, the near\npoint gradually recedes away. They find it difficult\nto see nearby objects comfortably and distinctly\nwithout corrective eye-glasses.  This defect is\ncalled Presbyopia.  It arises due to the gradual\nFigure 10.2\nFigure 10.2\nFigure 10.2\nFigure 10.2\nFigure 10.2\n(a), (b) The myopic eye, and (c) correction for myopia with a\nconcave lens\nFigure 10.3\nFigure 10.3\nFigure 10.3\nFigure 10.3\nFigure 10.3\n(a), (b) The hypermetropic eye, and (c)\ncorrection for hypermetropia\nN = Near point of a\n      hypermetropic eye.\nN’ = Near point of a\n      normal eye.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n164\nThink it over\nYou talk of wondrous things you see,\nYou say the sun shines bright;\nI feel him warm, but how can he\nOr make it day or night?\n – C.

By donating our eyes after we\ndie, we can light the life of a blind person.\nAbout 35 million people in the developing world are blind and most of them can be\ncured. About 4.5 million people with corneal blindness can be cured through corneal\ntransplantation of donated eyes. Out of these 4.5 million, 60% are children below the\nage of 12. So, if we have got the gift of vision, why not pass it on to somebody who does\nnot have it? What do we have to keep in mind when eyes have to be donated?\nn\nEye donors can belong to any age group or sex. People who use spectacles, or those\noperated for cataract, can still donate the eyes. People who are diabetic, have\nhypertension, asthma patients and those without communicable diseases can also\ndonate eyes.\nweakening of the ciliary muscles and diminishing flexibility of the\neye lens.  Sometimes, a person may suffer from both myopia and\nhypermetropia.  Such people often require bi-focal lenses. A common\ntype of bi-focal lenses consists of both concave and convex lenses.\nThe upper portion consists of a concave lens. It facilitates distant\nvision. The lower part is a convex lens.  It facilitates near vision.\n  These days, it is possible to correct the refractive defects with\ncontact lenses or through surgical interventions.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhat is meant by power of accommodation of the eye?\n2.\nA person with a myopic eye cannot see objects beyond 1.2 m distinctly.\nWhat should be the type of the corrective lens used to restore proper\nvision?\n3.\nWhat is the far point and near point of the human eye with normal\nvision?\n4.\nA student has difficulty reading the blackboard while sitting in the last\nrow.

For parallel refracting surfaces, as in a glass slab, the emergent ray\nis parallel to the incident ray.  However, it is slightly displaced laterally.\nHow would light get refracted through a transparent prism? Consider a\ntriangular glass prism. It has two triangular bases and three rectangular\nlateral surfaces. These surfaces are inclined to each other. The angle\nbetween its two lateral faces is called the angle of the prism. Let us now\ndo an activity to study the refraction of light through a triangular glass\nprism.\nn\nEyes must be removed within 4-6 hours after death. Inform the nearest eye bank\nimmediately.\nn\nThe eye bank team will remove the eyes at the home of the deceased or at a hospital.\nn\nEye removal takes only 10-15 minutes. It is a simple process and does not lead to\nany disfigurement.\nn\nPersons who were infected with or died because of AIDS, Hepatitis B or C, rabies,\nacute leukaemia, tetanus, cholera, meningitis or encephalitis cannot donate eyes.\nAn eye bank collects, evaluates and distributes the donated eyes. All eyes donated are\nevaluated using strict medical standards. Those donated eyes found unsuitable for\ntransplantation are used for valuable research and medical education. The identities\nof both the donor and the recipient remain confidential.\nOne pair of eyes gives vision to up to FOUR CORNEAL BLIND PEOPLE.\nActivity 10.1\nActivity 10.1\nActivity 10.1\nActivity 10.1\nActivity 10.1\nn\nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using drawing pins.\nn\nPlace a glass prism on it in such a way that it rests on its triangular\nbase. Trace the outline of the prism using a pencil.\nn\nDraw a straight line PE inclined to one of the refracting surfaces,\nsay AB, of the prism.\nn\nFix two pins, say at points P and Q, on the line PE as shown in\nFig. 10.4.\nn\nLook for the images of the pins, fixed at P and Q, through the\nother face AC.\nn\nFix two more pins, at points R and S, such that the pins at R and\nS and the images of the pins at P and Q lie on the same straight\nline.\nn\nRemove the pins and the glass prism.\nn\nThe line PE meets the boundary of the prism at point E\n(see Fig. 10.4). Similarly, join and produce the points R and S.  Let\nthese lines meet the boundary of the prism at E and F, respectively.\nJoin E and F.\nn\nDraw perpendiculars to the refracting surfaces AB and AC of the\nprism at points E and F, respectively.\nn\nMark the angle of incidence (∠i), the angle of refraction (∠r) and\nthe angle of emergence (∠e) as shown in Fig. 10.4.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n166\nActivity 10.2\nActivity 10.2\nActivity 10.2\nActivity 10.2\nActivity 10.2\nn\nTake a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow\nslit in its middle.\nn\nAllow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit. This gives a narrow beam\nof white light.\nn\nNow, take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on\none of its faces as shown in Fig. 10.5.\nn\nTurn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears\non a nearby screen.\nn\nWhat do you observe? You will find a beautiful band of colours.\nWhy does this happen?\nHere PE is the incident ray, EF is the refracted ray and FS is the\nemergent ray. You may note that a ray of light is entering from air to\nglass at the first surface AB. The light ray on refraction has bent towards\nthe normal. At the second surface AC, the light ray has entered from\nglass to air. Hence it has bent away from normal. Compare the angle of\nincidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the\nprism. Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab?\nThe peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an\nangle to the direction of the incident ray. This angle is called the angle of\ndeviation. In this case ∠D is the angle of deviation. Mark the angle of\ndeviation in the above activity and measure it.\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL\n10.4 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GLASS PRISM\nASS PRISM\nASS PRISM\nASS PRISM\nASS PRISM\nYou must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow.\nHow could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the\nrainbow? Before we take up this question, we shall first go back to the\nrefraction of light through a prism. The inclined refracting surfaces of a\nglass prism show exciting phenomenon.  Let us find it out through an\nactivity.\nPE – Incident ray\n∠i – Angle of incidence\nEF – Refracted ray\n∠r – Angle of refraction\nFS – Emergent ray\n∠e – Angle of emergence\n∠A – Angle of the prism\n∠D – Angle of deviation\nFigure 10.4\nFigure 10.4\nFigure 10.4\nFigure 10.4\nFigure 10.4 Refraction of light through a triangular glass prism\n2024-25\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n167\nThe prism has probably split the incident\nwhite light into a band of colours.  Note the\ncolours that appear at the two ends of the\ncolour band. What is the sequence of colours\nthat you see on the screen? The various\ncolours seen are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green,\nYellow, Orange and Red, as shown in\nFig. 10.5. The acronym VIBGYOR will help\nyou to remember the sequence of colours.\nThe band of the coloured components of a\nlight beam is called its spectrum. You might\nnot be able to see all the colours separately.\nYet something makes each colour distinct from the other. The splitting\nof light into its component colours is called dispersion.\nYou have seen that white light is dispersed\ninto its seven-colour components by a prism.\nWhy do we get these colours? Different colours\nof light bend through different angles with\nrespect to the incident ray, as they pass\nthrough a prism. The red light bends the least\nwhile the violet the most. Thus the rays of each\ncolour emerge along different paths and thus\nbecome distinct. It is the band of distinct\ncolours that we see in a spectrum.\nIsaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain\nthe spectrum of sunlight. He tried to split the colours of\nthe spectrum of white light further by using another similar\nprism. However, he could not get any more colours. He\nthen placed a second identical prism in an inverted position\nwith respect to the first prism, as shown in Fig. 10.6. This\nallowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through\nthe second prism. He found a beam of white light emerging\nfrom the other side of the second prism. This observation\ngave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven\ncolours.\nAny light that gives a spectrum similar to that of\nsunlight is often referred to as white light.\nA rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky\nafter a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion\nof sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the\natmosphere. A rainbow is always formed in a direction\nopposite to that of the Sun. The water droplets act like\nsmall prisms. They refract and disperse the incident\nsunlight, then reflect it internally, and finally refract it\nagain when it comes out of the raindrop (Fig. 10.8). Due\nto the dispersion of light and internal reflection, different\ncolours reach the observer’s eye.\nYou can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when\nyou look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water\nfountain, with the Sun behind you.\nFigure 10.5 \nFigure 10.5 \nFigure 10.5 \nFigure 10.5 \nFigure 10.5 Dispersion of white light by the glass prism\nFigure 10.6 \nFigure 10.6 \nFigure 10.6 \nFigure 10.6 \nFigure 10.6 Recombination of the spectrum of\nwhite light\nFigure 10.7 \nFigure 10.7 \nFigure 10.7 \nFigure 10.7 \nFigure 10.7 Rainbow in the sky\nFigure 10.8 \nFigure 10.8 \nFigure 10.8 \nFigure 10.8 \nFigure 10.8 Rainbow formation\nSunlight\nRaindrop\n2024-25\n\nScience\n168\nFigure 10.10\nFigure 10.10\nFigure 10.10\nFigure 10.10\nFigure 10.10\nAtmospheric refraction\neffects at sunrise and\nsunset\n10.5     ATMOSPHERIC REFRACTION\nYou might have observed the apparent random wavering or\nflickering of objects seen through a turbulent stream of hot air\nrising above a fire or a radiator. The air just above the fire becomes\nhotter than the air further up. The hotter air is lighter (less dense)\nthan the cooler air above it, and has a refractive index slightly\nless than that of the cooler air. Since the physical conditions of\nthe refracting medium (air) are not stationary, the apparent\nposition of the object, as seen through the hot air, fluctuates.\nThis wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction (refraction\nof light by the earth’s atmosphere) on a small scale in our local\nenvironment. The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on\na much larger scale. Let us see how we can explain it.\nTwinkling of stars\nThe twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight. The\nstarlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction\ncontinuously before it reaches the earth. The atmospheric refraction\noccurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the\natmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position\nof the star is slightly different from its actual position. The star appears\nslightly higher (above) than its actual position when viewed near the\nhorizon (Fig. 10.9). Further, this apparent position of the star is not\nstationary, but keeps on changing slightly, since the physical conditions\nof the earth’s atmosphere are not stationary, as was the case in the\nprevious paragraph. Since the stars are very distant, they approximate\npoint-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from\nthe star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star\nfluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers – the\nstar sometimes appears brighter, and at some other time, fainter, which\nis the twinkling effect.\nWhy don’t the planets twinkle? The planets are much\ncloser to the earth, and are thus seen as extended sources.\nIf we consider a planet as a collection of a large number\nof point-sized sources of light, the total variation in the\namount of light entering our eye from all the individual\npoint-sized sources will average out to zero, thereby\nnullifying the twinkling effect.\nAdvance sunrise and delayed sunset\nThe Sun is visible to us about 2 minutes before the actual\nsunrise, and about 2 minutes after the actual sunset\nbecause of atmospheric refraction. By actual sunrise, we\nmean the actual crossing of the horizon by the Sun. Fig.\n10.10 shows the actual and apparent positions of the\nSun with respect to the horizon. The time difference\nbetween actual sunset and the apparent sunset is about\n2 minutes. The apparent flattening of the Sun’s disc at\nsunrise and sunset is also due to the same phenomenon.\nFigure 10.9\nFigure 10.9\nFigure 10.9\nFigure 10.9\nFigure 10.9\nApparent star position\ndue to atmospheric\nrefraction\n2024-25\n\nThe Human Eye and the Colourful World\n169\n10.6  SCATTERING OF LIGHT\nThe interplay of light with objects around us gives rise to several\nspectacular phenomena in nature. The blue colour of the sky, colour of\nwater in deep sea, the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset\nare some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with. In the previous\nclass, you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles.\nThe path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible.\nHowever, its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the\nsize of the particles is relatively larger.\n10.6.1 Tyndall Effect\nThe earth’s atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles.\nThese particles include smoke, tiny water droplets, suspended particles\nof dust and molecules of air. When a beam of light strikes such fine\nparticles, the path of the beam becomes visible. The light reaches us,\nafter being reflected diffusely by these particles. The phenomenon of\nscattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect\nwhich you have studied in Class IX. This phenomenon is seen when a\nfine beam of sunlight enters a smoke-filled room through a small hole.\nThus, scattering of light makes the particles visible. Tyndall effect can\nalso be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense\nforest.  Here, tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light.\nThe colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering\nparticles. Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of\nlarger size scatter light of longer wavelengths.  If the size of the scattering\nparticles is large enough, then, the scattered light may even appear\nwhite.\n10.6.2 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue?\nThe molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible light. These are more effective in\nscattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer\nwavelengths at the red end. The red light has a wavelength about 1.8\ntimes greater than blue light. Thus, when sunlight passes through the\natmosphere, the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour (shorter\nwavelengths) more strongly than red. The scattered blue light enters\nour eyes. If the earth had no atmosphere, there would not have been\nany scattering. Then, the sky would have looked dark.  The sky appears\ndark to passengers flying at very high altitudes, as scattering is not\nprominent at such heights.\nYou might have observed that ‘danger’ signal lights are red in colour.\nDo you know why? The red is least scattered by fog or smoke.  Therefore,\nit can be seen in the same colour at a distance.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n170\nWhat you have learnt\nn\nThe ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects, by adjusting its\nfocal length, is called the accommodation of the eye.\nn\nThe smallest distance, at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain, is\ncalled the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision.  For a young\nadult with normal vision, it is about 25 cm.\nn\nThe common refractive defects of vision include myopia, hypermetropia and\npresbyopia. Myopia (short-sightedness – the image of distant objects is focussed\nbefore the retina) is corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power.\nHypermetropia (far-sightedness – the image of nearby objects is focussed beyond\nthe retina) is corrected by using a convex lens of suitable power.

    "jesc111": "Electricity\n11\nCHAPTER\nE\nlectricity has an important place in modern society. It is a controllable\nand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,\nhospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does\nit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate\nthe current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt\nto answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of\nelectric current and its applications.\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\n11.1 ELECTRIC CURRENT AND CIRCUIT\nWe are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\nsay that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\ntorch is turned off ), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow.\nHow do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the\ndirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the\nflow of electrons, which are negative charges.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n172\nIf a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in\ntime t, then the current I, through the cross-section is\nI\nQ\nt\n=\n(11.1)\nThe SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to\nthe charge contained in nearly 6 × 1018 electrons. (We know that an\nelectron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 × 10–19 C.) The electric\ncurrent is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the\nFrench scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836). One ampere is\nconstituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,\n1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere\n(1 mA = 10–3 A) or in microampere (1 µA = 10–6 A).\nAn instrument called ammeter measures electric\ncurrent in a circuit. It is always connected in series\nin a circuit through which the current is to be\nmeasured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic\ndiagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a\ncell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key.\nNote that the electric current flows in the circuit\nfrom the positive terminal of the cell to the negative\nterminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.\nFigure 11.1\nFigure 11.1\nFigure 11.1\nFigure 11.1\nFigure 11.1\nA schematic diagram of an electric circuit\ncomprising – cell, electric bulb, ammeter and\nplug key\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\nExample 11.1\nA current of 0.5 A is drawn by a filament of an electric bulb for 10\nminutes.

(11.1), we have\nQ\n= It\n= 0.5 A × 600 s\n= 300 C\n1.\nWhat does an electric circuit mean?\n2.\nDefine the unit of current.\n3.\nCalculate the number of electrons constituting one coulomb of charge.\n2024-25\n\nElectricity\n173\n11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE\n11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE\n11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE\n11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE\n11.2 ELECTRIC POTENTIAL AND POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE\nWhat makes the electric charge to flow? Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –\nalong the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it.\nWe define the electric potential difference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –\nPotential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)\nV\n=\nW/Q\n(11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandro Volta (1745 –1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other.\nTherefore, 1 volt = \n1 joule\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1 V  = 1 J C–1\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the\npoints between which the potential difference is to be measured.\nExample 11.2\nHow much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points\nhaving a potential difference 12 V?\nSolution\nThe amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential\ndifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C.

A\nstraight line plot shows that as the\ncurrent through a wire increases, the\npotential difference across the wire\nincreases linearly – this is Ohm’s law.\nActivity 11.2\nActivity 11.2\nActivity 11.2\nActivity 11.2\nActivity 11.2\nn\nTake a nichrome wire, a torch bulb, a 10 W bulb and an ammeter (0 – 5 A range), a plug\nkey and some connecting wires.\nn\nSet up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 1.5 V each in series with the ammeter\nleaving a gap XY in the circuit, as shown in Fig. 11.4.\nIn this Activity, you will find that approximately the\nsame value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant\nratio.\nIn 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it,  provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words –\nV ∝ I\n(11.4)\nor\nV/I\n=\nconstant\n=\nR\nor\nV\n=\nIR\n(11.5)\nIn Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges  through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω. According to Ohm’s law,\nR = V/I\n(11.6)\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\nis 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm = \n1 volt\n1 ampere\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\nI = V/R\n(11.7)\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical\nresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.\n2024-25\n\nElectricity\n177\nIn this Activity we observe that the current is different for different\ncomponents. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a\nconductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable\nresistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a\nhigher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers\neven higher resistance.\n11.5 FA\n11.5 FA\n11.5 FA\n11.5 FA\n11.5 FACTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST\nCTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST\nCTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST\nCTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST\nCTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTANCE OF A\nANCE OF A\nANCE OF A\nANCE OF A\nANCE OF A\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDS\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDS\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDS\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDS\nCONDUCTOR DEPENDS\nFigure 11.4\nFigure 11.4\nFigure 11.4\nFigure 11.4\nFigure 11.4\nn\nComplete the circuit by connecting the nichrome wire in the gap XY.

[Note: Always take out the key\nfrom the plug after measuring the current through the circuit.]\nn\nReplace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through\nit by measuring the reading of the ammeter.\nn\nNow repeat the above step with the 10 W bulb in the gap XY.\nn\nAre the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY?\nWhat do the above observations indicate?\nn\nYou may repeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the\nammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations.\nActivity 11.3\nActivity 11.3\nActivity 11.3\nActivity 11.3\nActivity 11.3\nn\nComplete an electric circuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter, a nichrome wire of length l\n[say, marked (1)] and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.5.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n178\nIt is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when\nthe length of the wire is doubled. The ammeter reading is increased when\na thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the\ncircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different\nmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used.\nOn applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the\nresistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of\ncross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\nproportional to its length (l) and inversely proportional to the area of\ncross-section (A). That is,\nR ∝ l\n(11.8)\nand\nR ∝ 1/A\n(11.9)\nCombining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get\nR ∝ l\nA\nor,\nR = ρ l\nA\n(11.10)\nwhere ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical\nresistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity is\nΩ m. It is a characteristic property of the material. The metals and alloys\nFigure 11.5 \nFigure 11.5 \nFigure 11.5 \nFigure 11.5 \nFigure 11.5 Electric circuit to study the factors on which the  resistance of conducting wires depends\nn\nNow, plug the key.

A\nthicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area. Again note down the current through the\ncircuit.\nn\nInstead of taking a nichrome wire, connect a copper wire [marked (4) in Fig. 11.5] in the\ncircuit. Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of the\nfirst nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current.\nn\nNotice the difference in the current in all cases.\nn\nDoes the current depend on the length of the conductor?\nn\nDoes the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used?\n2024-25\n\nElectricity\n179\nhave very low resistivity in the  range of 10–8 Ω m to  10–6 Ω m. They are\ngood conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have\nresistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 Ω m. Both the resistance and\nresistivity of a material vary with temperature.\nTable 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher\nthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in\nelectrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used\nalmost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and\naluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.\nTable 11.2 Electrical resistivity* of some substances at 20°C\nMaterial\nResistivity (ΩΩΩΩΩ m)\nConductors\nSilver\n1.60 × 10–8\nCopper\n1.62 × 10–8\nAluminium\n2.63 × 10–8\nTungsten\n5.20 × 10–8\nNickel\n6.84 × 10–8\nIron\n10.0 × 10–8\nChromium\n12.9 × 10–8\nMercury\n94.0 × 10–8\nManganese\n1.84 × 10–6\nAlloys\nConstantan\n49 × 10–6\n(alloy of Cu and Ni)\nManganin\n44 × 10–6\n(alloy of Cu, Mn and Ni)\nNichrome\n100 × 10–6\n(alloy of Ni, Cr, Mn and Fe)\nInsulators\nGlass\n1010 – 1014\nHard rubber\n1013 – 1016\nEbonite\n1015 – 1017\nDiamond\n1012 - 1013\nPaper (dry)\n1012\n* You need not memorise these values.

(b) How much\ncurrent will an electric heater coil draw from a 220 V source, if\nthe resistance of the heater coil is 100 Ω?\nSolution\n(a) We are given V = 220 V; R = 1200 Ω.\nFrom Eq. (12.6), we have the current I = 220 V/1200 Ω = 0.18 A.\n(b) We are given, V = 220 V, R = 100 Ω.\nFrom Eq. (11.6), we have the current I = 220 V/100 Ω = 2.2 A.\nNote the difference of current drawn by an electric bulb and electric\nheater from the same 220 V source!\n2024-25\n\nScience\n180\nExample 11.4\nThe potential difference between the terminals of an electric heater\nis 60 V when it draws a current of 4 A from the source.

If the\ndiameter of the wire is 0.3 mm, what will be the resistivity of the\nmetal at that temperature? Using Table 11.2, predict the material\nof the wire.\nSolution\nWe are given the resistance R of the wire = 26 Ω, the diameter\nd = 0.3 mm = 3 × 10-4 m, and the length l of the wire = 1 m.\nTherefore, from Eq.

We\nhave noticed how the current through a conductor depends upon its\nresistance and the potential difference across its ends. In various electrical\ngadgets, we often use resistors in various combinations. We now therefore\nintend to see how Ohm’s law can be applied to combinations of resistors.\nThere are two methods of joining the resistors together. Figure 11.6\nshows an electric circuit in which three resistors having resistances R1,\nR2 and R3, respectively, are joined end to end. Here the resistors are said\nto be connected in series.\nFigure 11.6\nFigure 11.6\nFigure 11.6\nFigure 11.6\nFigure 11.6 Resistors in series\n2024-25\n\nScience\n182\nFigure 11.7\nFigure 11.7\nFigure 11.7\nFigure 11.7\nFigure 11.7 Resistors in parallel\nYou will observe that the value of the current in the ammeter is the\nsame, independent of its position in the electric circuit. It means that in\na series combination of resistors the current is the same in every part of\nthe circuit or the same current through each resistor.\nActivity 11.4\nActivity 11.4\nActivity 11.4\nActivity 11.4\nActivity 11.4\nn\nJoin three resistors of different values in series. Connect them\nwith a battery, an ammeter and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\nYou may use the resistors of values like 1 Ω, 2 Ω, 3 Ω etc., and a\nbattery of 6 V for performing this Activity.\nn\nPlug the key. Note the ammeter reading.\nn\nChange the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the\nresistors. Note the ammeter reading each time.\nn\nDo you find any change in the value of current through the\nammeter?\n11.6.1 Resistors in Series\nWhat happens to the value of current when a number of resistors are\nconnected in series in a circuit? What would be their equivalent\nresistance? Let us try to understand these with the help of the following\nactivities.\nFigure 11.7 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors\nare connected together between points X and Y. Here, the resistors are\nsaid to be connected in parallel.\n2024-25\n\nElectricity\n183\nActivity 11.5\nActivity 11.5\nActivity 11.5\nActivity 11.5\nActivity 11.5\nn\nIn Activity 11.4, insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the\nseries combination of three resistors, as shown in Fig. 11.6.\nn\nPlug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading. It\ngives the potential difference across the series combination of\nresistors. Let it be V. Now measure the potential difference across\nthe two terminals of the battery. Compare the two values.\nn\nTake out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter. Now insert\nthe voltmeter across the ends X and P of the first resistor, as\nshown in Fig. 11.8.\nFigure 11.8\nFigure 11.8\nFigure 11.8\nFigure 11.8\nFigure 11.8\nn\nPlug the key and measure the potential difference across the first\nresistor. Let it be V1.\nn\nSimilarly, measure the potential difference across the other two\nresistors, separately. Let these values be V2 and V3, respectively.\nn\nDeduce a relationship between V, V1, V2 and V3.\nYou will observe that the potential difference V is equal to the sum of\npotential differences V1, V2, and V3. That is the total potential difference\nacross a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential\ndifference across the individual resistors. That is,\nV = V1 + V2  + V3\n(11.11)\nIn the electric circuit shown in Fig. 11.8, let I be the current through\nthe circuit. The current through each resistor is also I. It is possible to\nreplace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor\nof resistance R, such that the potential difference V across it, and the\ncurrent I through the circuit remains the same. Applying the Ohm’s law\nto the entire circuit, we have\nV = I R\n(11.12)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n184\nOn applying Ohm’s law to the three resistors separately, we further\nhave\nV1 = I R1\n[11.13(a)]\nV2 = I R2\n[11.13(b)]\nand\nV3 = I R3\n[11.13(c)]\nFrom Eq. (11.11),\nI R = I R1 + I R2 + I R3\nor\nRs = R1 +R2 + R3\n(11.14)\nWe can conclude that when several resistors are joined in series, the\nresistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual\nresistances, R1, R2, R3, and is thus greater than any individual resistance.\nExample 11.7\nAn electric lamp, whose resistance is 20 Ω, and a conductor of 4 Ω\nresistance are connected to a 6 V battery (Fig. 11.9). Calculate (a) the\ntotal resistance of the circuit, (b) the current through the circuit, and (c)\nthe potential difference across the electric lamp and conductor.\nSolution\nThe resistance of electric lamp, R1 = 20 Ω,\nThe resistance of the conductor connected in series, R2 = 4 Ω.\nThen the total resistance in the circuit\nR\n= R1 + R2\nRs\n= 20 Ω + 4 Ω = 24 Ω.\nThe total potential difference across the two terminals of the battery\nV = 6 V.\nNow by Ohm’s law, the current through the circuit is given by\nI\n=\nV/Rs\n=\n6 V/24 Ω\n=\n0.25 A.\nFigure 11.9\nFigure 11.9\nFigure 11.9\nFigure 11.9\nFigure 11.9 An electric lamp connected in series with\na resistor of 4 Ω to a 6 V battery\n2024-25\n\nElectricity\n185\nApplying Ohm’s law to the electric lamp and conductor separately,\nwe get potential difference across the electric lamp,\nV1 = 20 Ω × 0.25 A\n= 5 V;\nand,\nthat across the conductor, V2  =  4 Ω × 0.25 A\n         =  1 V.\nSuppose that we like to replace the series combination of electric\nlamp and conductor by a single and equivalent resistor. Its resistance\nmust be such that a potential difference of 6 V across the battery\nterminals will cause a current of 0.25 A in the circuit. The resistance\nR of this equivalent resistor would be\nR\n= V/I\n= 6 V/ 0.25 A\n= 24 Ω.\nThis is the total resistance of the series circuit; it is equal to the sum\nof the two resistances.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nDraw a schematic diagram of a circuit consisting of a battery of three\ncells of 2 V each, a 5 Ω resistor, an 8 Ω resistor, and a 12 Ω resistor, and\na plug key, all connected in series.\n2.\nRedraw the circuit of Question 1, putting in an ammeter to measure\nthe current through the resistors and a voltmeter to measure the\npotential difference across the 12 Ω resistor. What would be the readings\nin the ammeter and the voltmeter?\n11.6.2 Resistors in Parallel\nNow, let us consider the arrangement of three resistors joined in parallel\nwith a combination of cells (or a battery), as shown in Fig.11.7.\nActivity 11.6\nActivity 11.6\nActivity 11.6\nActivity 11.6\nActivity 11.6\nn\nMake a parallel combination, XY, of three\nresistors having resistances R1, R2, and R3,\nrespectively. Connect it with a battery, a\nplug key and an ammeter, as shown in\nFig. 11.10. Also connect a voltmeter in\nparallel with the combination of resistors.\nn\nPlug the key and note the ammeter reading.\nLet the current be I. Also take the voltmeter\nreading. It gives the potential difference V,\nacross the combination. The potential\ndifference across each resistor is also V. This\ncan be checked by connecting the voltmeter\nacross each individual resistor (see\nFig. 11.11).\nFigure 11.10\nFigure 11.10\nFigure 11.10\nFigure 11.10\nFigure 11.10\n2024-25\n\nScience\n186\nn\nTake out the plug from the key.

Note the ammeter\nreading, I1.\nFigure 11.11\nFigure 11.11\nFigure 11.11\nFigure 11.11\nFigure 11.11\nn\nSimilarly, measure the currents through R2 and R3. Let these be I2 and I3, respectively.\nWhat is the relationship between I, I1, I2 and I3?\nIt is observed that the total current I, is equal to the sum of the\nseparate currents through each branch of the combination.\nI = I1 + I2 + I3\n(11.15)\nLet Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of\nresistors. By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,\nwe have\nI = V/Rp\n(11.16)\nOn applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we have\nI1 = V /R1;    I2 = V /R2; and I3 = V /R3\n(11.17)\nFrom Eqs. (11.15) to (11.17), we have\n  V/Rp = V/R1 + V/R2 + V/R3\nor\n  1/Rp = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3\n(11.18)\nThus, we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance\nof a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the\nreciprocals of the individual resistances.\nExample 11.8\nIn the circuit diagram given in Fig. 11.10, suppose the resistors R1,\nR2 and R3 have the values 5 Ω, 10 Ω, 30 Ω, respectively, which have\nbeen connected to a battery of 12 V. Calculate (a) the current through\neach resistor, (b) the total current in the circuit, and (c) the total circuit\nresistance.\nSolution\nR1 = 5 Ω, R2 = 10 Ω, and R3 = 30 Ω.\nPotential difference across the battery, V = 12 V.\nThis is also the potential difference across each of the individual\nresistor; therefore, to calculate the current in the resistors, we use\nOhm’s law.\nThe current  I1, through R1 =\nV/ R1\nI1 = 12 V/5 Ω  =\n2.4 A.\n2024-25\n\nElectricity\n187\nThe current  I2, through R2\n= V/ R2\nI2 = 12 V/10 Ω= 1.2 A.\nThe current  I3, through R3\n= V/R3\nI3 = 12 V/30 Ω= 0.4 A.\nThe total current in the circuit,\nI =  I1 + I2 + I3\n= (2.4 + 1.2 + 0.4) A\n= 4 A\nThe total resistance Rp, is given by [Eq.

Calculate\n(a) the total resistance in the circuit, and (b) the total current flowing\nin the circuit.\nSolution\nSuppose we replace the parallel resistors R1 and R2 by an\nequivalent resistor of resistance, R′. Similarly we replace\nthe parallel resistors R3, R4 and R5 by an equivalent single\nresistor of resistance R″. Then using Eq. (11.18), we have\n1/ R′ = 1/10 + 1/40\n= 5/40; that is R′  = 8 Ω.\nSimilarly,\n1/ R″\n= 1/30 + 1/20 + 1/60 = 6/60;\nthat is, R″  = 10 Ω.\nThus, the total resistance, R = R′ + R″ = 18 Ω.\nTo calculate the current, we use Ohm’s law, and get\n I = V/R = 12 V/18 Ω = 0.67 A.\nWe have seen that in a series circuit the current is constant\nthroughout the electric circuit. Thus it is obviously impracticable to\nconnect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series, because they\nneed currents of widely different values to operate properly (see Example\n11.3). Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works.\nIf you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on\nmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending\nlot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone. On the other hand, a parallel\ncircuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets. The total\nresistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq. (11.18). This is\nhelpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and\nrequires different current to operate properly.\nFigure 11.12\nFigure 11.12\nFigure 11.12\nFigure 11.12\nFigure 11.12\nAn electric circuit showing\nthe combination of series\nand parallel resistors\n2024-25\n\nScience\n188\n11.7 HEA\n11.7 HEA\n11.7 HEA\n11.7 HEA\n11.7 HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nTING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT\nWe know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy. The\nchemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between\nits two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current\nthrough a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery. We\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater, electric iron etc.\nConsider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let\nthe potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\nP\nV\nVI\n=\nQ\nt =\n(11.19)\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P × t,\nthat is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This\nenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is\nH = VIt\n(11.20)\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nJudge the equivalent resistance when the following are connected in\nparallel – (a) 1 Ω and 106 Ω, (b) 1 Ω and 103 Ω, and 106 Ω.\n2.\nAn electric lamp of 100 Ω, a toaster of resistance 50 Ω, and a water\nfilter of resistance 500 Ω are connected in parallel to a 220 V source.\nWhat is the resistance of an electric iron connected to the same source\nthat takes as much current as all three appliances, and what is the\ncurrent through it?\n3.\nWhat are the advantages of connecting electrical devices in parallel\nwith the battery instead of connecting them in series?\n4.\nHow can three resistors of resistances 2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 6 Ω be connected\nto give a total resistance of (a) 4 Ω, (b) 1 Ω?\n5.\nWhat is (a) the highest, (b) the lowest total resistance that can be secured\nby combinations of four coils of resistance 4 Ω, 8 Ω, 12 Ω, 24 Ω?\n2024-25\n\nElectricity\n189\nApplying Ohm’s law [Eq. (11.5)], we get\nH = I2 Rt\n(11.21)\nThis is known as Joule’s law of heating. The\nlaw implies that heat produced in a resistor is\n(i) directly proportional to the square of current\nfor a given resistance, (ii) directly proportional to\nresistance for a given current, and (iii) directly\nproportional to the time for which the current flows\nthrough the resistor. In practical situations, when\nan electric appliance is connected to a known\nvoltage source, Eq. (11.21) is used after\ncalculating the current through it, using the\nrelation I = V/R.\nExample 11.10\nAn electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is\nat the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum.\nThe voltage is 220 V. What are the current and the resistance in each\ncase?\nSolution\nFrom Eq. (11.19), we know that the power input is\nP = V I\nThus the current I = P/V\n(a)\nWhen heating is at the maximum rate,\nI = 840 W/220 V = 3.82 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/3.82 A = 57.60 Ω.\n(b)\nWhen heating is at the minimum rate,\nI = 360 W/220 V = 1.64 A;\nand the resistance of the electric iron is\nR = V/I = 220 V/1.64 A = 134.15 Ω.\nExample 11.11\n100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 Ω resistance. Find the\npotential difference across the resistor.\nSolution\nH = 100 J, R = 4 Ω, t = 1 s, V = ?\nFrom Eq. (11.21) we have the current through the resistor as\nI\n=\n√(H/Rt)\n=\n√[100 J/(4 Ω × 1 s)]\n=\n5 A\nThus the potential difference across the resistor, V [from Eq. (11.5)] is\nV\n=\nIR\n=\n5 A × 4 Ω\n=\n20 V.\nFigure 11.13\nFigure 11.13\nFigure 11.13\nFigure 11.13\nFigure 11.13\nA steady current in a purely resistive electric circuit\n2024-25\n\nScience\n190\n11.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of\nElectric Current\nThe generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of\nelectric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties.\nHowever, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications.\nThe electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating.\nThe electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated.\nAnother common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit. In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhy does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element\ndoes?\n2.\nCompute the heat generated while transferring 96000 coulomb of charge\nin one hour through a potential difference of 50 V.\n3.\nAn electric iron of resistance 20 Ω takes a current of 5 A.

This is also the rate of consumption of energy.\nEquation (11.21) gives the rate at which electric energy is dissipated\nor consumed in an electric circuit. This is also termed as electric power.\nThe power P is given by\nP  =  VI\nOr\nP  =  I2R = V2/R\n(11.22)\nThe SI unit of electric power is watt (W). It is the power consumed by\na device that carries 1 A of current when operated at a potential difference\nof 1 V. Thus,\n       1 W  =  1 volt × 1 ampere = 1 V A\n(11.23)\nThe unit ‘watt’ is very small. Therefore, in actual practice we use a\nmuch larger unit called ‘kilowatt’. It is equal to 1000 watts. Since electrical\nenergy is the product of power and time, the unit of electric energy is,\ntherefore, watt hour (W h). One watt hour is the energy consumed when\n1 watt of power is used for 1 hour. The commercial unit of electric energy\nis kilowatt hour (kW h), commonly known as ‘unit’.\n1 kW h = 1000 watt × 3600 second\n= 3.6 × 106 watt second\n= 3.6 × 106 joule (J)\nMore to Know!\nMany people think that electrons are consumed in an electric circuit. This is wrong!\nWe pay the electricity board or electric company to provide energy to move electrons\nthrough the electric gadgets like electric bulb, fan and engines.

A cell\ngenerates a potential difference across its terminals. It is measured in volts (V).\nn\nResistance is a property that resists the flow of electrons in a conductor. It controls\nthe magnitude of the current. The SI unit of resistance is ohm (Ω).\nn\nOhm’s law: The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly\nproportional to the current through it, provided its temperature remains the same.\nn\nThe resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length, inversely on its area of\ncross-section, and also on the material of the conductor.\nn\nThe equivalent resistance of several resistors in series is equal to the sum of\ntheir individual resistances.\nn\nA set of resistors connected in parallel has an equivalent resistance Rp given by\n1\n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n...\np\nR\nR\nR\nR\n=\n+\n+\n+\nn\nThe electrical energy dissipated in a resistor is given by\nW = V × I × t\nn\nThe unit of power is watt (W).

Let\nus take a closer look at these rules.\n8.2.1 Inherited Traits\nWhat exactly do we mean by similarities and differences? We know that\na child bears all the basic features of a human being.

Based on\nthis evidence, suggest a possible rule for the inheritance of earlobe\ntypes.\n8.2.2 Rules for the Inheritance of Traits –––––\nMendel’s Contributions\nThe rules for inheritance of such traits in human beings are related to\nthe fact that both the father and the mother contribute practically equal\namounts of genetic material to the child. This means that each trait can\nbe influenced by both paternal and maternal DNA. Thus, for each trait\nthere will be two versions in each child. What will, then, the trait seen in\nthe child be? Mendel (see box) worked out the main rules of such\ninheritance, and it is interesting to look at some of his experiments from\nmore than a century ago.\nFigure 8.2\nFigure 8.2\nFigure 8.2\nFigure 8.2\nFigure 8.2\n(a) Free and (b) attached\nearlobes. The lowest part\nof the ear, called the\nearlobe, is closely attached\nto the side of the head in\nsome of us, and not\nin others. Free and\nattached earlobes are two\nvariants found in human\npopulations.\ndifferent kinds of advantages. Bacteria that can withstand heat will survive\nbetter in a heat wave, as we have discussed earlier. Selection of variants\nby environmental factors forms the basis for evolutionary processes, as\nwe will discuss in later sections.\n(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n130\nMendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden\npeas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and\nso on.  He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and\na short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the\npercentages of tall or short progeny.\nIn the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-\ngeneration, or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were\ntall. This meant that only one of the parental traits\nwas seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the F1\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\nplants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\nof the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,\nthe second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nplants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\nto propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\ncontrolling traits are present in sexually reproducing\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\ndifferent, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\ninheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3.\nGregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884)\nMendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and\nmathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a\nteaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went\nback to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied\nthe inheritance of traits in peas and other organisms earlier, but Mendel\nblended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one\nto keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation.\nThis helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance.\nFigure 8.3\nFigure 8.3\nFigure 8.3\nFigure 8.3\nFigure 8.3\nInheritance of traits\nover two generations\nActivity 8.2\nActivity 8.2\nActivity 8.2\nActivity 8.2\nActivity 8.2\nn\nIn Fig. 8.3, what experiment would we do to confirm that the F2\ngeneration did in fact have a 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt and tt trait\ncombinations?\nIn this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a\nshort plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the\nplant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits\nlike ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are\ncalled recessive traits. Work out which trait would be considered\ndominant and which one recessive in Fig. 8.4.\n2024-25\n\nHeredity\n131\nx\nRR yy\n(round, green)\nrr YY\n(wrinkled, yellow)\nRy\nrY\nRr Yy\n(round, yellow)\nF1\nx\nRr Yy\nF1\nRr Yy\nF1\n315 round, yellow\n108 round, green\n101 wrinkled, yellow\n32 wrinkled, green\n9\n3\n3\n1\n556 seeds\n16\nRY\nRy\nrY\nry\nRY\nRy\nrY\nry\nRRYY\nRRYy\nRrYY\nRrYy\nRRYy\nRRyy\nRrYy\nRryy\nRrYY\nRrYy\nrrYY\nrrYy\nRrYy\nRryy\nrrYy\nrryy\nF2\nFigure 8.5\nFigure 8.5\nFigure 8.5\nFigure 8.5\nFigure 8.5\nIndependent inheritance\nof two separate traits,\nshape and colour of seeds\nWhat happens when pea plants showing two different\ncharacteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other?\nWhat do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short\nplant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have\nround seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits.\nBut what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate\nF2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find\nthat some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some\nwere short plants with wrinkled seeds.  However, there would also\nbe some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them\nwould be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short,\nbut have round seeds. You can see as to how new combinations of\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5). Thus, the tall/short trait and the round\nseed/wrinkled seed trait are independently inherited.\n8.2.3 How do these Traits get Expressed?\nHow does the mechanism of heredity work? Cellular DNA is\nthe information source for making proteins in the cell. A section\nof DNA that provides information for one protein is called the\ngene for that protein. How do proteins control the\ncharacteristics that we are discussing here? Let us take the\nexample of tallness as a characteristic. We know that plants\nhave hormones that can trigger growth. Plant height can thus\ndepend on the amount of a particular plant hormone. The\namount of the plant hormone made will depend on the\nefficiency of the process for making it. Consider now an enzyme\nthat is important for this process. If this enzyme works\nefficiently, a lot of hormone will be made, and the plant will be\ntall. If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes\nthe enzyme less efficient, the amount of hormone will be less,\nand the plant will be short. Thus, genes control characteristics,\nor traits.\nIf the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been\ndiscussing are correct, then both parents must be contributing\nequally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction.\nWe have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter. If both\nparents can help determine the trait in the progeny, both parents\nmust be contributing a copy of the same gene. This means that\neach pea plant must have two sets of all genes, one inherited from\neach parent. For this mechanism to work, each germ cell must\nhave only one gene set.\nHow do germ-cells make a single set of genes from the normal two\ncopies that all other cells in the body have? If progeny plants inherited a\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and\n‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\nFigure 8.4\n2024-25\n\nScience\n132\ninherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms. But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work?\n8.2.4 Sex Determination\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically determined. However,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls.\nBut so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex?\nThe explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is\nodd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,\nwhile men are XY. Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be?\nAs Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father. A child who inherits\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nwho inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy.\nFigure 8.6\nFigure 8.6\nFigure 8.6\nFigure 8.6\nFigure 8.6\nSex determination in\nhuman beings\n2024-25\n\nHeredity\n133\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nHow do Mendel’s experiments show that traits may be dominant or\nrecessive?\n2.\nHow do Mendel’s experiments show that traits are inherited\nindependently?\n3.\nA man with blood group A marries a woman with blood group O and\ntheir daughter has blood group O.

If the\ncopies are not identical, the trait that gets expressed is called the dominant trait\nand the other is called the recessive trait.\nn\nTraits in one individual may be inherited separately, giving rise to new combinations\nof traits in the offspring of sexual reproduction.\nn\nSex is determined by different factors in various species. In human beings, the\nsex of the child depends on whether the paternal chromosome is X (for girls) or Y\n(for boys).\nE\nX\nE\nR\nC\nI\nS\nE\nS\n1.\nA Mendelian experiment consisted of breeding tall pea plants bearing violet flowers\nwith short pea plants bearing white flowers.

    "jesc106": "Science\n100\nControl and\nCoordination\n6\nCHAPTER\nI\nn the previous chapter, we looked at life processes involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth.\nWhy do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse.  Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves.\nIf we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities.\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1\n6.1 ANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nANIMALS – NERVOUS SYSTEM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied in Class IX. Touching a hot\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination\n101\nobject is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. We need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.\nThis information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland  [Fig. 6.1 (b)].\nIt is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.\nLook at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmission.\nActivity 6.1\nActivity 6.1\nActivity 6.1\nActivity 6.1\nActivity 6.1\nn\nPut some sugar in your mouth.

If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about\npossible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across\na similar situation when you have a cold?\nFigure 6.1 \nFigure 6.1 \nFigure 6.1 \nFigure 6.1 \nFigure 6.1 (a) Structure of neuron, (b)     Neuromuscular\njunction\n(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n102\n6.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions?\n‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in response to something in the environment. We say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’.\nWhat exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations?\nLet us consider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.  If\nnerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses.\nThinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons.\nIf this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body.\nSimilarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt!\nHow does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve?\nThe best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain.\nOf course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough.  In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought processes.  However, even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses.\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination\n103\nCan you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright\nlight is focussed on your eyes?\n6.1.2 Human Brain\nIs reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body.  The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3).\nThey receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it.\nWe also think about our actions. Writing, talking, moving a chair,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next.  So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles.  This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles.  The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking.  As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs.\nThe brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain.\nThe fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on.  There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain.  Based on\nFigure 6.2 \nFigure 6.2 \nFigure 6.2 \nFigure 6.2 \nFigure 6.2 Reflex arc\n2024-25\n\nScience\n104\nall this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is\npassed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary\nmuscles, for example, our leg muscles.  However, certain sensations are\ndistinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we\nhave eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre\nassociated with  hunger, which is in a separate part of the fore-brain.\nStudy the labelled diagram of the human brain. We have seen that\nthe different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function\nof each part?\nLet us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it.\nIn fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe\nor digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in\nthe size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a\nchair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not\nhave any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are\ncontrolled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions\nincluding blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the\nmedulla in the hind-brain.\nThink about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,\npicking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain\ncalled the cerebellum. It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions\nand maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what\nwould happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not\nthinking about it.\nFigure 6.3\nFigure 6.3\nFigure 6.3\nFigure 6.3\nFigure 6.3 Human brain\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination\n105\n6.1.3 How are these Tissues protected?\nA delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of\nactivities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord.\n6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action?\nSo far, we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape?\nThe answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far, what\ndo you think the differences between these would be?\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhat is the difference between a reflex action and walking?\n2.\nWhat happens at the synapse between two neurons?\n3.\nWhich part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body?\n4.\nHow do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)?\n5.\nWhat is the role of the brain in reflex action?\n6.2 COORDINA\n6.2 COORDINA\n6.2 COORDINA\n6.2 COORDINA\n6.2 COORDINATION IN PL\nTION IN PL\nTION IN PL\nTION IN PL\nTION IN PLANTS\nANTS\nANTS\nANTS\nANTS\nAnimals have a nervous system for controlling and coordinating the\nactivities of the body. But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air. What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n106\nThere is no growth involved in this movement. On the other hand, the\ndirectional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement – one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth.\n6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response?\nFigure 6.4\nFigure 6.4\nFigure 6.4\nFigure 6.4\nFigure 6.4 The sensitive plant\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information.\nFinally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4).\n6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object.\nThis causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it.\nMore commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example.\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination\n107\nEnvironmental triggers such as light, or gravity\nwill change the directions that plant parts grow in.\nThese directional, or tropic, movements can be either\ntowards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help\nthe plant?\nPlants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’\nrefers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms.\nLet us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow.\nGrowth-related movement of plants will be even slower.\nEven in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly.\nSo controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly.\nFor this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly.\nActivity 6.2\nActivity 6.2\nActivity 6.2\nActivity 6.2\nActivity 6.2\nn\nFill a conical flask with water.\nn\nCover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh.\nn\nKeep two or three freshly germinated bean\nseeds on the wire mesh.\nn\nTake a cardboard box which is open from one\nside.\nn\nKeep the flask in the box in such a manner\nthat the open side of the box faces light coming\nfrom a window (Fig. 6.5).\nn\nAfter two or three days, you will notice that\nthe shoots bend towards light and roots away\nfrom light.\nn\nNow turn the flask so that the shoots are away\nfrom light and the roots towards light. Leave it\nundisturbed in this condition for a few days.\nn\nHave the old parts of the shoot and root\nchanged direction?\nn\nAre there differences in the direction of the new\ngrowth?\nn\nWhat can we conclude from this activity?\nFigure 6.5\nFigure 6.5\nFigure 6.5\nFigure 6.5\nFigure 6.5\nResponse of the plant to the direction of light\nFigure 6.6 \nFigure 6.6 \nFigure 6.6 \nFigure 6.6 \nFigure 6.6 Plant showing geotropism\n2024-25\n\nScience\n108\nElectrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication.\nIf, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently. These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect.\nDifferent plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action.\nLet us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2].\nWhen growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot.\nThis concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light.\nAnother example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhat are plant hormones?\n2.\nHow is the movement of leaves of the sensitive plant different from the\nmovement of a shoot towards light?\n3.\nGive an example of a plant hormone that promotes growth.\n4.\nHow do auxins promote the growth of a tendril around a support?\n5.\nDesign an experiment to demonstrate hydrotropism.\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination\n109\n6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS\n6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS\n6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS\n6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS\n6.3 HORMONES IN ANIMALS\nHow are such chemical, or hormonal, means of information transmission\nused in animals? What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However, the two alternate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved?\nIf the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.\nAdrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.\nActivity 6.3\nActivity 6.3\nActivity 6.3\nActivity 6.3\nActivity 6.3\nn\nLook at Fig. 6.7.\nn\nIdentify the endocrine glands mentioned in the figure.\nn\nSome of these glands have been listed in Table 6.1 and discussed\nin the text. Consult books in the library and discuss with your\nteachers to find out about other glands.\nRemember that plants have hormones that control their directional\ngrowth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their role in directional growth. We have never seen\nan animal growing more in one direction or the other, depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places.\nPlants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example.\nBut we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully\nmaintained even during the growth of children.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n110\nLet us examine some examples to understand how hormones help\nin coordinated growth. We have all seen salt packets which say ‘iodised\nsalt’ or ‘enriched with iodine’. Why is it important for us to have iodised\nsalt in our diet? Iodine is necessary for the thyroid gland to make\nthyroxin hormone. Thyroxin regulates carbohydrate, protein and fat\nmetabolism in the body so as to provide the best balance for growth.\nIodine is essential for the synthesis of thyroxin. In case iodine is deficient\nin our diet, there is a possibility that we might suffer from goitre. One\nof the symptoms in this disease is a swollen neck. Can you correlate\nthis with the position of the thyroid gland in Fig. 6.7?\nSometimes we come across people who are either very short (dwarfs)\nor extremely tall (giants). Have you ever wondered how this happens?\nGrowth hormone is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary. As\nits name indicates, growth hormone regulates growth and development\nof the body. If there is a deficiency of this hormone in childhood, it\nleads to dwarfism.\nYou must have noticed many dramatic changes in your appearance\nas well as that of your friends as you approached 10–12 years of age.\nThese changes associated with puberty are because of the secretion of\ntestosterone in males and oestrogen in females.\nDo you know anyone in your family or friends who has been advised\nby the doctor to take less sugar in their diet because they are suffering\nfrom diabetes? As a treatment, they might be taking injections of insulin.\nThis is a hormone which is produced by the pancreas and helps in\nregulating blood sugar levels. If it is not secreted in proper amounts,\nthe sugar level in the blood rises causing many harmful effects.\nFigure 6.7 Endocrine glands in human beings (a) male, (b) female\n(a)\n(b)\nDo You Know?\nHypothalamus plays\nan important role in\nthe release of many\nhormones. For\nexample, when the\nlevel of growth\nhormone is low, the\nhypothalamus\nreleases growth\nhormone releasing\nfactor which\nstimulates the\npituitary gland to\nrelease growth\nhormone.\n2024-25\n\nControl and Coordination\n111\nIf it is so important that hormones should be secreted in precise\nquantities, we need a mechanism through which this is done. The timing\nand amount of hormone released are regulated by feedback mechanisms.\nFor example, if the sugar levels in blood rise, they are detected by the\ncells of the pancreas which respond by producing more insulin. As the\nblood sugar level falls, insulin secretion is reduced.\nTable 6.1 : Some important hormones and their functions\nActivity 6.4\nActivity 6.4\nActivity 6.4\nActivity 6.4\nActivity 6.4\nn  Hormones are secreted by endocrine glands and have specific functions.

This principle marks a departure\nfrom the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes\na gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt\nto discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different\nsubject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education\n(1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key\nreasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity\nand initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,\nnot as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.\nFlexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.\nThe methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The\ntextbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and\nactivities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates\nthe hard work done by the textbook development team responsible for this book. We\nwish to thank the Chairman of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor\nJ.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Rupamanjari Ghosh, School\nof Physical Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, for guiding the work of\nthis committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we\nare grateful to them and their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to\nthe institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon\ntheir resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of\nF\nO\nR\nE\nW\nO\nR\nD\n2024-25\n\n(iv)\nthe National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and\nHigher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairmanship\nof Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and\ncontribution.

The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing\nthe content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with\ncreative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the\nexercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into\nconsideration in this exercise.\nContents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n•\nOverlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the\nsame class\n•\nSimilar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n•\nDifficulty level\n•\nContent, which is easily accessible to students without much\ninterventions from teachers and can be learned by children through\nself-learning or peer-learning\n•\nContent, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the\nchanges given above.\n2024-25\n\n2024-25\n\nThis textbook of Science for Class X is a continuation of our attempt in the Class IX\nScience textbook to comply with the guidelines of the National Curriculum\nFramework-2005. We had to work within a limited time frame and also had our own\nconstraints coming in the way of this radical change. The revised and re-structured\nsyllabus for Class X covers selected topics in the broad themes of — Materials,\nThe World of the Living, How Things Work, Natural Phenomena and Natural Resources.\nWe have interpreted the syllabus to present a coherent coverage of scientific concepts\nrelated to our daily life on the select topics. It is an integrated approach to science at\nthis level, with no sharp divisions into disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology\nand Environmental Science.\nThere has been a conscious attempt to address the relevant social concerns in this\nscience textbook wherever possible — the concerns for people with special needs, the\nissues of gender discrimination, energy and environment have found their natural\nplace in this book. Students have been encouraged to get into the debates on some of\nthe management concerns (for sustainable development, for example) so that they\ncan arrive at their own decisions after a scientific analysis of all the facts.\nThis book has some features which are meant to enhance its effectiveness. The\ntheme of each chapter has been introduced with examples from daily life, and if possible,\nby a relevant activity that the students have to perform. The entire approach of the\nbook  is, in fact, activity-based, i.e., the students are required to construct knowledge\nthemselves from these activities. The emphasis is not on definitions and technical\nterms, but on the concepts involved. Special care has been taken so that the rigour of\nscience is not lost while simplifying the language. Difficult and challenging ideas,\nwhich are not to be covered at this stage, have often been placed as extra material in\nthe boxes in light orange. The excitement of doing science comes from pursuing the\nunknown — the students would have the opportunity to think and explore somewhat\nbeyond the syllabus and may feel the urge to continue their scientific expedition at\nhigher levels. All such box items, including brief biography of scientists, are, of course,\nnon-evaluative.\nSolved examples are provided, wherever felt necessary, to clarify a concept. The\nin-text questions after a main section are for the students to check their understanding\nof the topic. At the end of each chapter, there is a quick review of the important points\ncovered in the chapter. We have introduced some multiple choice questions in the\nexercises. There are problems of different difficulty levels answers to the multiple-\nchoice questions and numericals, and hints for the difficult questions are included at\nthe end of the book.\nP\nR\nE\nF\nA\nC\nE\n2024-25\n\n(viii)\nThis book has been made possible because of the active participation of many\npeople.

Ravindra,\nJoint Director, NCERT, and Professor Hukum Singh, Head, Department of Education\nin Science and Mathematics, NCERT, specially for their keen interest in the development\nof the book and for all the administrative support.

We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place.\nYou may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese questions.\nFigure 1.1\nBurning of a magnesium ribbon in air and collection of magnesium\noxide in a watch-glass\nActivity 1.1\nActivity 1.1\nActivity 1.1\nActivity 1.1\nActivity 1.1\nCAUTION: This Activity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance.

This description of a\nchemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a\nshorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a\nword-equation.\nThe word-equation for the above reaction would be –\nMagnesium + Oxygen\n→Magnesium oxide\n(1.1)\n            (Reactants)\n(Product)\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),\nmagnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is\nmagnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product.\nA word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an\narrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand\nside (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are\nwritten on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them.\nThe arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of\nthe reaction.\nYou must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a\ndazzling white flame and changes into a white powder. This powder is\nmagnesium oxide. It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium\nand oxygen present in the air.\n2024-25\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n3\n1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations?\nChemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O2  →  MgO\n(1.2)\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air.\n1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants.\nIn other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step.\nThe word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –\nZinc + Sulphuric acid  →  Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\nchemical equation –\nZn + H2SO4 → ZnSO4 + H2\n(1.3)\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\nsides of the arrow.\nElement\nNumber of atoms in\nNumber of atoms\nreactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\nZn\n1\n1\nH\n2\n2\nS\n1\n1\nO\n4\n4\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation.\nLet us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2\n(1.4)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n4\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation.\nFe   +   H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   H2\n(1.5)\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5).\nElement\nNumber of atoms\nNumber of atoms\nin reactants (LHS)\nin products (RHS)\nFe\n1\n3\nH\n2\n2\nO\n1\n4\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or (H2O)4. Now the partly balanced equation\nbecomes –\nFe   +   4 H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   H2\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation.\nTo equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS.\nStep III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe3O4 and the element\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\nthe LHS.\nTo balance the oxygen atoms –\nThe equation would be –\n  Fe   +   4   H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   4 H2\nAtoms of\nIn reactants\nIn products\noxygen\n(i)\nInitial\n1 (in H2O)\n4 (in Fe3O4)\n(ii)\nTo balance\n1×4\n4\nAtoms of\nIn reactants\nIn products\nhydrogen\n(i)\nInitial\n8 (in 4 H2O)\n2 (in H2)\n(ii)\nTo balance\n8\n2 × 4\n(1.6)\n(partly balanced equation)\n(1.7)\n(partly balanced equation)\n2024-25\n\nChemical Reactions and Equations\n5\nTo equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS.\n3   Fe   +   4   H2O   →   Fe3O4   +   4   H2\n(1.8)\nStep VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we\ncount atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.\n3Fe + 4H2O → Fe3O4 + 4H2\nThe numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.\nStep VII: Writing Symbols of Physical States\nWriting Symbols of Physical States\nWriting Symbols of Physical States\nWriting Symbols of Physical States\nWriting Symbols of Physical States  Carefully examine\nthe above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states.\nTo make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water.\nThe balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)  → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\n(1.10)\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H2O to indicate that in this\nreaction water is used in the form of steam.\nUsually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them.\nSometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation. For example –\nCO(g) + 2H (g)\n2\n340atm\nCH OH(l)\n3\n\n→\n\n(1.11)\n6CO (aq)\n12H O(l)\nC H O (aq)\n6O\n2\n2\n6\n12\n6\n+\n+\nSunlight\nChlorophyll\n\n→\n\n22\n2\n(aq)\n6H O(l)\n+\n(1.12)\n   (Glucose)\nUsing these steps, can you balance Eq.

Nor do atoms\ndisappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical\nreactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to\nproduce new substances.

Reactions in which heat is\nreleased along with the formation of products are called exothermic\nchemical reactions.\nOther examples of exothermic reactions are –\n(i)\nBurning of natural gas\nCH4(g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g)\n(1.17)\n(ii)\nDo you know that respiration is an exothermic process?\nWe all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy\nfrom the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler\nsubstances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain\ncarbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose.\nThis glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides\nenergy. The special name of this reaction is respiration, the process of\nwhich you will study in Chapter 6.\nC6H12O6(aq) + 6O2(aq) → 6CO2(aq) + 6H2O(l) + energy\n(1.18)\n(Glucose)\n(iii)\nThe decomposition of vegetable matter into compost is also an\nexample of an exothermic reaction.\nIdentify the type of the reaction taking place in Activity 1.1, where\nheat is given out along with the formation of a single product.\nDo You Know?\nA solution of slaked lime produced by the reaction 1.13 is used for whitewashing\nwalls. Calcium hydroxide reacts slowly with the carbon dioxide in air to form a thin\nlayer of calcium carbonate on the walls. Calcium carbonate is  formed after two to\nthree days of whitewashing and gives a shiny finish to the walls. It is interesting to note\nthat the chemical formula for marble is also CaCO3.\nCa(OH)2(aq) + CO2(g)\n→\nCaCO3(s)\n + H2O(l)\n(1.14)\n(Calcium\n(Calcium\nhydroxide)\ncarbonate)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n88888\nFigure 1.5\nHeating of lead nitrate and\nemission of nitrogen dioxide\nFigure 1.4\nCorrect way of heating\nthe boiling tube\ncontaining crystals\nof ferrous sulphate\nand of smelling the\nodour\nActivity 1.6\nActivity 1.6\nActivity 1.6\nActivity 1.6\nActivity 1.6\nn\nTake about 2 g lead nitrate powder in a boiling\ntube.\nn\nHold the boiling tube with a pair of tongs and\nheat it over a flame, as shown in Fig. 1.5.\nn\nWhat do you observe?

This is a decomposition reaction. Ferrous\nsulphate crystals (FeSO4. 7H2O) lose water when heated and the colour\nof the crystals changes. It then decomposes to ferric oxide (Fe2O3),\nsulphur dioxide (SO2) and sulphur trioxide (SO3). Ferric oxide is a solid,\nwhile SO2 and SO3 are gases.\nDecomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon\ndioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in\nvarious industries. Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime. It has\nmany uses – one is in the manufacture of cement.

This process\nis commonly known as rusting of iron. Some other metals also get\ntarnished in this manner. Have you noticed the colour of the coating\nformed on copper and silver? When a metal is attacked by substances\naround it such as moisture, acids, etc., it is said to corrode and this\nprocess is called corrosion. The black coating on silver and the green\ncoating on copper are other examples of corrosion.\nCorrosion causes damage to car bodies, bridges, iron railings, ships\nand to all objects made of metals, specially those of iron. Corrosion of\niron is a serious problem. Every year an enormous amount of money is\nspent to replace damaged iron.

    "jesc105": "Life Processes\n5\nCHAPTER\nH\now do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not\nalive? If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man\nshouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What\nif the dog or the cow or the man were asleep? We would still think that\nthey were alive, but how did we know that? We see them breathing, and\nwe know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that\nthey are alive? We see them green, some of us will say. But what about\nplants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over\ntime, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we\ntend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as\ncommon evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough.\nMovements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye –\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional\nbiologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular\nmovement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why\nthere is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not.\nWhy are molecular movements needed for life? We have seen in earlier\nclasses that living organisms are well-organised structures; they can\nhave tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them,\nand so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised,\nordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down\nover time. If order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive. So\nliving creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures.\nSince all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move\nmolecules around all the time.\nWhat are the maintenance processes in living organisms?\nLet us explore.\n5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHA\n5.1 WHAT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nT ARE LIFE PROCESSES?\nThe maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when\nthey are not doing anything particular. Even when we are just sitting in\n2024-25\n\nScience\n80\nclass, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on.\nThe processes which together perform this maintenance job are\nlife processes.\nSince these maintenance processes are needed to prevent damage\nand break-down, energy is needed for them. This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition.\nIf the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside. Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based.\nDepending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes.\nThe outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody are necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break-down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process\nof acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it in the process\nof break-down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call\nrespiration.\nIn the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment.\nBut what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells.\nWe have seen previously how, in multi-cellular organisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they perform. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues.\nHowever, this poses a problem, since the food and oxygen are now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body.\nWhen chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation,  they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-\nproducts are  therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside  by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n81\ndesign in multi-cellular organisms are followed, a specialised tissue for\nexcretion will be developed, which means that the transportation system\nwill need to transport waste away from cells to this excretory tissue.\nLet us consider these various processes, so essential to maintain\nlife, one by one.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhy is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multi-\ncellular organisms like humans?\n2.\nWhat criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive?\n3.\nWhat are outside raw materials used for by an organism?\n4.\nWhat processes would you consider essential for maintaining life?\n5.2 NUTRITION\n5.2 NUTRITION\n5.2 NUTRITION\n5.2 NUTRITION\n5.2 NUTRITION\nWhen we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat.\nHow do living things get their food?\nThe general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water. These organisms, the autotrophs, include green\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances.\nThese complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs.\nHeterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi.\n5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant.\nWe will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n82\nLet us now see what actually happens during the process of\nphotosynthesis. The following events occur during this process –\nFigure 5.2\nFigure 5.2\nFigure 5.2\nFigure 5.2\nFigure 5.2\nVariegated leaf (a) before\nand (b) after starch test\nFigure 5.1\nFigure 5.1\nFigure 5.1\nFigure 5.1\nFigure 5.1\nCross-section of a leaf\nActivity 5.1\nActivity 5.1\nActivity 5.1\nActivity 5.1\nActivity 5.1\nn Take a potted plant with variegated leaves – for example, money plant\nor crotons.\nn Keep the plant in a dark room for three days so that all the starch\ngets used up.\nn Now keep the plant in sunlight for about six hours.\nn Pluck a leaf from the plant. Mark the green areas in it and trace them\non a sheet of paper.\nn Dip the leaf in boiling water for a few minutes.\nn After this, immerse it in a beaker containing alcohol.\nn Carefully place the above beaker in a water-bath and heat till the\nalcohol begins to boil.\nn What happens to the colour of the leaf? What is the colour of the\nsolution?\nn Now dip the leaf in a dilute solution of iodine for a few minutes.\nn Take out the leaf and rinse off the iodine solution.\nn Observe the colour of the leaf and compare this with the tracing of\nthe leaf done in the beginning (Fig. 5.2).\nn What can you conclude about the presence of starch in various areas\nof the leaf?\n(i)\nAbsorption of light energy by\nchlorophyll.\n(ii)\nConversion of light energy to chemical\nenergy and splitting of water molecules\ninto hydrogen and oxygen.\n(iii)\nReduction of carbon dioxide to\ncarbohydrates.\nThese steps need not take place one after\nthe other immediately. For example, desert\nplants take up carbon dioxide at night and\nprepare an intermediate which is acted upon\nby the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll\nduring the day.\nLet us see how each of the components of\nthe above reaction are necessary for\nphotosynthesis.\nIf you carefully observe a cross-section of a\nleaf under the microscope (shown in Fig. 5.1),\nyou will notice that some cells contain green\ndots. These green dots are cell organelles called\nchloroplasts which contain chlorophyll. Let us\ndo an activity which demonstrates that\nchlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis.\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n83\nNow, let us study how the plant\nobtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX,\nwe had talked about stomata (Fig. 5.3)\nwhich are tiny pores present on the\nsurface of the leaves. Massive amounts\nof gaseous exchange takes place in the\nleaves through these pores for the\npurpose of photosynthesis. But it is\nimportant to note here that exchange\nof gases occurs across the surface of\nstems, roots and leaves as well. Since\nlarge amounts of water can also be lost\nthrough these stomata, the plant\ncloses these pores when it does not\nneed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the\npore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water\nflows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore\ncloses if the guard cells shrink.\nn\nTake two healthy potted plants\nwhich are nearly the same size.\nn\nKeep them in a dark room for\nthree days.\nn\nNow place each plant on\nseparate glass plates. Place a\nwatch-glass containing potassium\nhydroxide by the side of one of\nthe plants. The potassium\nhydroxide is used to absorb\ncarbon dioxide.\nn\nCover both plants with separate\nbell-jars as shown in Fig. 5.4.\nn\nUse vaseline to seal the bottom\nof the jars to the glass plates so\nthat the set-up is air-tight.\nn\nKeep the plants in sunlight for\nabout two hours.\nn\nPluck a leaf from each plant and check for the presence of starch as in the above activity.\nn\nDo both the leaves show the presence of the same amount of starch?\nn\nWhat can you conclude from this activity?\nFigure 5.3 \nFigure 5.3 \nFigure 5.3 \nFigure 5.3 \nFigure 5.3 (a) Open and (b) closed stomatal pore\nActivity 5.2\nActivity 5.2\nActivity 5.2\nActivity 5.2\nActivity 5.2\nBased on the two activities performed above, can we design an\nexperiment to demonstrate that sunlight is essential for photosynthesis?\nSo far, we have talked about how autotrophs meet their energy\nrequirements. But they also need other raw materials for building their\nbody. Water used in photosynthesis is taken up from the soil by the\nroots in terrestrial plants. Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus,\niron and magnesium are taken up from the soil. Nitrogen is an essential\nelement used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. This is\nFigure 5.4 Experimental set-up (a) with potassium\nhydroxide (b) without potassium hydroxide\n(a)\n(b)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n84\ntaken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as\norganic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from\natmospheric nitrogen.\n5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition\nEach organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it.\nExamples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms.\n5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?\nSince the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\norganism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\ndifferent functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-\nvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell.\n5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts.\nVarious regions are specialised to perform different functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body? We shall discuss this\nprocess here.\nFigure 5.5\nFigure 5.5\nFigure 5.5\nFigure 5.5\nFigure 5.5\nNutrition in Amoeba\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n85\nActivity 5.3\nActivity 5.3\nActivity 5.3\nActivity 5.3\nActivity 5.3\nn\nTake 1 mL starch solution (1%) in two test tubes (A and B).\nn\nAdd 1 mL saliva to test tube A and leave both test tubes undisturbed\nfor 20-30 minutes.\nn\nNow add a few drops of dilute iodine solution to the test tubes.\nn\nIn which test tube do you observe a colour change?\nn\nWhat does this indicate about the presence or absence of starch\nin the two test tubes?\nn\nWhat does this tell us about the action of saliva on starch?\nWe eat various types of food which has to pass through the same\ndigestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar. The food\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue.\nIt is necessary to move the food in\na regulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of\ncanal has muscles that contract\nrhythmically in order to push the food\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.\nFrom the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nthoroughly with more digestive juices.\nThe digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you\nthink is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the\nstomach from the action of the acid under normal conditions. We\nFigure 5.6\nFigure 5.6\nFigure 5.6\nFigure 5.6\nFigure 5.6 Human alimentary canal\n2024-25\n\nScience\n86\nhave often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above?\nThe exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine.\nThe small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act.\nBile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats.\nFats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol.\nDigested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.\nThe unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter.\nMore to Know!\nDental caries\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine. It begins\nwhen bacteria acting on sugars produce acids that softens or demineralises the enamel.\nMasses of bacterial cells together with food particles stick to the teeth to form dental\nplaque. Saliva cannot reach the tooth surface to neutralise the acid as plaque covers\nthe teeth. Brushing the teeth after eating removes the plaque before the bacteria\nproduce acids. If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection.\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n87\n5.3 RESPIR\n5.3 RESPIR\n5.3 RESPIR\n5.3 RESPIR\n5.3 RESPIRAAAAATION\nTION\nTION\nTION\nTION\nActivity 5.4\nActivity 5.4\nActivity 5.4\nActivity 5.4\nActivity 5.4\nn\nTake some freshly prepared lime\nwater in a test tube.\nn\nBlow air through this lime water.\nn\nNote how long it takes for the lime\nwater to turn milky.\nn\nUse a syringe or pichkari to pass air\nthrough some fresh lime water\ntaken in another test tube (Fig. 5.7).\nn\nNote how long it takes for this lime\nwater to turn milky.\nn\nWhat does this tell us about the\namount of carbon dioxide in the air\nthat we breathe out?\n1.\nWhat are the differences between autotrophic nutrition and heterotrophic\nnutrition?\n2.\nWhere do plants get each of the raw materials required for photosynthesis?\n3.\nWhat is the role of the acid in our stomach?\n4.\nWhat is the function of digestive enzymes?\n5.\nHow is the small intestine designed to absorb digested food?\nTube\nTest tube containing\nlime water\nLime\nwater\nRubber\ntube\n(a)\n(b)\nPichkari\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\nActivity 5.5\nActivity 5.5\nActivity 5.5\nActivity 5.5\nActivity 5.5\nn\nTake some fruit juice or sugar solution and add some yeast to\nthis.

Dip the free end of the glass\ntube into a test tube containing freshly prepared lime water.\nn\nWhat change is observed in the lime water and how long does it\ntake for this change to occur?\nn\nWhat does this tell us about the products of fermentation?\nWe have discussed nutrition in organisms in the last section. The\nfood material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to\nprovide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in\ndifferent ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely\ninto carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not\ninvolve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This process takes place in the cytoplasm. Further, the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place\nin the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-\ndown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. This\nFigure 5.7\nFigure 5.7\nFigure 5.7\nFigure 5.7\nFigure 5.7\n(a) Air being passed into lime water with a pichkari/\nsyringe, (b) air being exhaled into lime water\n2024-25\n\nScience\n88\nprocess breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three\nmolecules of carbon dioxide. The other product is water. Since this\nprocess takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic\nrespiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater\nthan in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen\nin our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is\ntaken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a\nthree-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during\nsudden activity causes cramps.\nFigure 5.8\nFigure 5.8\nFigure 5.8\nFigure 5.8\nFigure 5.8 Break-down of glucose by various pathways\nThe energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used\nto synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other\nactivities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise\nto a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions\ntaking place in the cell.\nATP\nATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes. The energy released during\nthe process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic\nphosphate.\nEndothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions. When the\nterminal phosphate linkage in ATP is broken using water, the energy equivalent to\n30.5 kJ/mol is released.\nThink of how a battery can provide energy for many different kinds of uses. It can be\nused to obtain mechanical energy, light energy, electrical energy and so on. Similarly,\nATP can be used in the cells for the contraction of muscles, protein synthesis,\nconduction of nervous impulses and many other activities.\nSince the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic\norganisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen. We\nhave seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large\ninter-cellular spaces ensure that all cells are in contact with air. Carbon\ndioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here. They can go into\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n89\ncells, or away from them and out into the air. The direction of diffusion\ndepends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of\nthe plant. At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, CO2\nelimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day,\nCO2 generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence\nthere is no CO2 release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at\nthis time.\nAnimals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen\nfrom the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide\nproduced. Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the\natmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen\ndissolved in water.\nActivity 5.6\nActivity 5.6\nActivity 5.6\nActivity 5.6\nActivity 5.6\nn\nObserve fish in an aquarium. They open and close their mouths\nand the gill-slits (or the operculum which covers the gill-slits)\nbehind their eyes also open and close. Are the timings of the\nopening and closing of the mouth and gill-slits coordinated in some\nmanner?\nn\nCount the number of times the fish opens and closes its mouth in\na minute.\nn\nCompare this to the number of times you breathe in and out in a\nminute.\nSince the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared\nto the amount of oxygen in the air, the rate of breathing in aquatic\norganisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms.\nFishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the\ngills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood.\nTerrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for\nrespiration. This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in\ndifferent animals. All these organs have a structure that increases\nthe surface area which is in contact with the oxygen-rich\natmosphere. Since the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide\nhas to take place across this surface, this surface is very fine\nand delicate. In order to protect this surface, it is usually placed\nwithin the body, so there have to be passages that will take air\nto this area. In addition, there is a mechanism for moving the air\nin and out of this area where the oxygen is absorbed.\nIn human beings (Fig. 5.9), air is taken into the body through\nthe nostrils. The air passing through the nostrils is filtered by\nfine hairs that line the passage. The passage is also lined with\nmucus which helps in this process. From here, the air passes\nthrough the throat and into the lungs. Rings of cartilage are\npresent in the throat. These ensure that the air-passage does\nnot collapse.\nUsing tobacco directly or\nany product of tobacco in\nthe form of cigar, cigarettes,\nbidis, hookah, gutkha, etc.,\nis harmful. Use of tobacco\nmost commonly affects the\ntongue, lungs, heart and\nliver.

The alveoli provide a surface\nwhere the exchange of gases can take place. The walls of the alveoli\ncontain an extensive network of blood-vessels. As we have seen\nin earlier years, when we breathe in, we lift our ribs and flatten\nour diaphragm, and the chest cavity becomes larger as a result.\nBecause of this, air is sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded\nalveoli. The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body\nfor release into the alveoli, and the oxygen in the alveolar air is\ntaken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported\nto all the cells in the body. During the breathing cycle, when air is\ntaken in and let out, the lungs always contain a residual volume\nof air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed\nand for the carbon dioxide to be released.\nWhen the body size of animals is large,  the diffusion pressure\nalone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body.\nInstead, respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the\nlungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before\nreleasing it. In human beings, the respiratory pigment is\nhaemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen. This pigment\nis present in the red blood corpuscles. Carbon dioxide is more\nsoluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in\nthe dissolved form in our blood.\nFigure 5.9\nFigure 5.9\nFigure 5.9\nFigure 5.9\nFigure 5.9 Human respiratory system\nDo You Know?\nSmoking is injurious to\nhealth.\nLung cancer is one of\ncommon causes of\ndeaths in the world.

In Class IX, we learnt about blood\nbeing a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called\nplasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon\ndioxide and nitrogenous wastes in dissolved form. Oxygen is carried by\nthe red blood corpuscles. Many other substances like salts, are also\ntransported by the blood. We thus need a pumping organ to push blood\naround the body, a network of tubes to reach all the tissues and a system\nin place to ensure that this network can be repaired if damaged.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n92\nThe heart is a muscular organ which is\nas big as our fist (Fig. 5.10). Because\nboth oxygen and carbon dioxide have to\nbe transported by the blood, the heart\nhas different chambers to prevent the\noxygen-rich blood from mixing with the\nblood containing carbon dioxide. The\ncarbon dioxide-rich blood has to reach\nthe lungs for the carbon dioxide to be\nremoved, and the oxygenated blood from\nthe lungs has to be brought back to the\nheart. This oxygen-rich blood is then\npumped to the rest of the body.\nWe can follow this process step by\nstep (Fig. 5.11). Oxygen-rich blood from\nthe lungs comes to the thin-walled upper\nchamber of the heart on the left, the left atrium. The left atrium relaxes\nwhen it is collecting this blood. It then contracts, while the next chamber,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates.\nThis transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation. Since ventricles have to pump blood into various\norgans, they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do. Valves ensure\nthat blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract.\nOxygen enters the blood in the lungs\nThe separation of the right side and the left side of\nthe heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de-\noxygenated blood from mixing. Such separation\nallows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the\nbody. This is useful in animals that have high\nenergy needs, such as birds and mammals, which\nconstantly use energy to maintain their body\ntemperature. In animals that do not use energy\nfor this purpose, the body temperature depends\non the temperature in the environment. Such\nanimals, like amphibians or  many reptiles have\nthree-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing\nof the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood\nstreams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two\nchambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped\nto the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly\nto the rest of the body. Thus, blood goes only once\nthrough the heart in the fish during one cycle of\npassage through the body. On the other hand, it goes through the heart\ntwice during each cycle in other vertebrates. This is known as double\ncirculation.\nOur pump — the heart\nFigure 5.10\nFigure 5.10\nFigure 5.10\nFigure 5.10\nFigure 5.10\nSchematic sectional\nview of the human heart\nFigure 5.11\nFigure 5.11\nFigure 5.11\nFigure 5.11\nFigure 5.11\nSchematic representation of transport and exchange\nof oxygen and carbon dioxide\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n93\nMore to Know!\nBlood pressure is measured with an instrument called sphygmomanometer. High\nblood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of\narterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture\nof an artery and internal bleeding.\nBlood pressure\nThe force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This\npressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the\nartery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure\nin artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal\nsystolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg.\nThe tubes – blood vessels\nArteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various\norgans of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high\npressure, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. Veins collect the blood\nfrom different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need\nthick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they\nhave valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction.\nOn reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and\nsmaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells.\nThe smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called\ncapillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding\ncells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together\nto form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue.\nMaintenance by platelets\nWhat happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about\nsituations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of\nblood from the system has to be minimised. In addition, leakage would\nlead to a loss of pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the\n2024-25\n\nScience\n94\npumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate\naround the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at\nthese points of injury.\nLymph\nThere is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is\ncalled lymph or tissue fluid. Through the pores present in the walls of\ncapillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into\nintercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein.\nLymph drains into lymphatic capillaries from the intercellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins.\nLymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood.\n5.4.2 Transportation in Plants\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots.\nIf the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations.\nEnergy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however, can be very large in plants such as very tall\ntrees.\nPlant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem  moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other, phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX.\nTransport of water\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the root and the soil. Water, therefore,\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n95\nmoves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means\nthat there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column\nof water that is steadily pushed upwards.\nHowever, this pressure by itself is unlikely to be enough to move\nwater over the heights that we commonly see in plants. Plants use another\nstrategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the\nplant body.\nActivity 5.8\nActivity 5.8\nActivity 5.8\nActivity 5.8\nActivity 5.8\nn\nTake two small pots of approximately the same size and having\nthe same amount of soil. One should have a plant in it. Place a\nstick of the same height as the plant in the other pot.\nn\nCover the soil in both pots with a plastic sheet so that moisture\ncannot escape by evaporation.\nn\nCover both sets, one with the plant and the other with the stick,\nwith plastic sheets and place in bright sunlight for half an hour.\nn\nDo you observe any difference in the two cases?\nProvided that the plant has an adequate\nsupply of water, the water which is lost through the\nstomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels\nin the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration.\nThus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nof water in the xylem.\nTransport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants.\nNow let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions.\nUnlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple\nphysical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising\nFigure 5.12\nFigure 5.12\nFigure 5.12\nFigure 5.12\nFigure 5.12\nMovement of water during transpiration in a tree\n2024-25\n\nScience\n96\nenergy. Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using\nenergy from ATP. This increases the osmotic pressure of the tissue\ncausing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the\nphloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to\nmove material according to the plant’s needs. For example, in the spring,\nsugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds\nwhich need energy to grow.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhat are the components of the transport system in human beings?\nWhat are the functions of these components?\n2.\nWhy is it necessary to separate oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in\nmammals and birds?\n3.\nWhat are the components of the transport system in highly organised\nplants?\n4.\nHow are water and minerals transported in plants?\n5.\nHow is food transported in plants?\n5.5 EX\n5.5 EX\n5.5 EX\n5.5 EX\n5.5 EXCRETION\nCRETION\nCRETION\nCRETION\nCRETION\nWe have already discussed how organisms get rid of gaseous wastes\ngenerated during photosynthesis or respiration. Other metabolic activities\ngenerate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological\nprocess involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from\nthe body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to\ndo this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple\ndiffusion from the body surface into the surrounding\nwater. As we have seen in other processes, complex\nmulti-cellular organisms use specialised organs to\nperform the same function.\n5.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings\nThe excretory system of human beings (Fig. 5.13)\nincludes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary\nbladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the\nabdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra.\nHow is urine produced? The purpose of making\nurine is to filter out waste products from the blood.\nJust as CO2 is removed from the blood in the lungs,\nnitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are\nremoved from blood in the kidneys. It is then no\nsurprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,\nFigure 5.13\nExcretory system in human beings\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n97\nlike in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood\ncapillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate\n (Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephrons packed close together.\nSome substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube.\nThe amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder.\nUrine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is\nunder nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere.\nAs a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.\nMore to Know!\nArtificial kidney (Hemodialysis)\nKidneys are vital organs for survival. Several factors like infections, injury or restricted\nblood flow to kidneys reduce the activity of kidneys. This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis.\nArtificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid.\nThis fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient’s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion.\nThe purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily.\nHowever, the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules.\nFigure 5.14\nFigure 5.14\nFigure 5.14\nFigure 5.14\nFigure 5.14\nStructure of a nephron\n2024-25\n\nScience\n98\n5.5.2 Excretion in Plants\nPlants use completely different\nstrategies for excretion than those\nof animals. Oxygen itself can be\nthought of as a waste product\ngenerated during photosynthesis!\nWe have discussed earlier how\nplants deal with oxygen as well as\nCO2. They can get rid of excess water\nby transpiration. For other wastes,\nplants use the fact that many of\ntheir tissues consist of dead cells,\nand that they can even lose some\nparts such as leaves. Many plant\nwaste products are stored in\ncellular vacuoles. Waste products\nmay be stored in leaves that fall off.\nOther waste products are stored as\nresins and gums, especially in old\nxylem. Plants also excrete some\nwaste substances into the soil\naround them.\nWhat you have learnt\nn\nMovement of various types can be taken as an indication of life.\nn\nMaintenance of life requires processes like nutrition, respiration, transport of\nmaterials within the body and excretion of waste products.\nn\nAutotrophic nutrition involves the intake of simple inorganic materials from the\nenvironment and using an external energy source like the Sun to synthesise complex\nhigh-energy organic material.\nn\nHeterotrophic nutrition involves the intake of complex material prepared by other\norganisms.\nn\nIn human beings, the food eaten is broken down by various steps along the\nalimentary canal and the digested food is absorbed in the small intestine to be sent\nto all cells in the body.\nThink it over!\nOrgan donation\nOrgan donation is a generous act of donating an\norgan to a person who suffers from non-function of\norgan(s). Donation of an organ may be done by the\nconsent of the donor and his/her family. Anyone\nregardless of age or gender can become an organ\nand tissue donor. Organ transplants can save or\ntransform the life of a person. Transplantation is\nrequired because recipient’s organ has been\ndamaged or has failed by disease or injury. In organ\ntransplantation the organ is surgically removed\nfrom one person (organ donor) and transplanted to\nanother person (the recipient). Common\ntransplantations include corneas, kidneys, heart,\nliver, pancreas, lungs, intestines and bone marrow.\nMost organ and tissue donations occur just after\nthe donor has died or when the doctor declares a\nperson brain dead. But some organs such as\nkidney, part of a liver, lung, etc., and tissues can be\ndonated while the donor is alive.\n?\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n1.\nDescribe the structure and functioning of nephrons.\n2.\nWhat are the methods used by plants to get rid of excretory products?\n3.\nHow is the amount of urine produced regulated?\n2024-25\n\nLife Processes\n99\nn\nDuring the process of respiration, organic compounds such as glucose are broken\ndown to provide energy in the form of ATP. ATP is used to provide energy for other\nreactions in the cell.\nn\nRespiration may be aerobic or anaerobic. Aerobic respiration makes more energy\navailable to the organism.\nn\nIn human beings, the transport of materials such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, food\nand excretory products is a function of the circulatory system. The circulatory\nsystem consists of the heart, blood and blood vessels.\nn\nIn highly differentiated plants, transport of water, minerals, food and other materials\nis a function of the vascular tissue which consists of xylem and phloem.\nn\nIn human beings, excretory products in the form of soluble nitrogen compounds\nare removed by the nephrons in the kidneys.\nn\nPlants use a variety of techniques to get rid of waste material.

You will be surprised to know that a wire\nof about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold.\nIt is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be\ngiven different shapes according to our needs.\nCan you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels?\nDo you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do\nthe following Activity to find out the answer.\nActivity 3.5\nActivity 3.5\nActivity 3.5\nActivity 3.5\nActivity 3.5\nn\nTake an aluminium or copper\nwire.

Does\nthe metal wire melt?\nThe above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat\nand have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and\ncopper. Lead and mercury are comparatively poor conductors of heat.\nDo metals also conduct electricity? Let us find out.\nFigure 3.1\nFigure 3.1\nFigure 3.1\nFigure 3.1\nFigure 3.1\nMetals are good\nconductors of heat.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n39\nYou must have seen that the wires that carry current\nin your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC)\nor a rubber-like material. Why are electric wires coated\nwith such substances?\nWhat happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce\na sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface\nare said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of\nmetals?\n3.1.2 Non-metals\nIn the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals\nas compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,\nsulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either  solids\nor gases except bromine which is a liquid.\nDo non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals?\nLet us find out.\nActivity 3.6\nActivity 3.6\nActivity 3.6\nActivity 3.6\nActivity 3.6\nn\nSet up an electric circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2.\nn\nPlace the metal to be tested in the circuit\nbetween terminals A and B as shown.\nn\nDoes the bulb glow?

You\nmust have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their\nphysical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example –\n(i)\nAll metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature.\nIn Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting\n2024-25\n\nScience\n40\npoints but gallium and caesium have very low melting points.\nThese two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm.\n(ii)\nIodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous.\n(iii)\nCarbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each\nform is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is\nthe hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting\nand boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a\nconductor of electricity.\n(iv)\nAlkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they\ncan be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting\npoints.\nElements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals\non the basis of their chemical properties.\nActivity 3.8\nActivity 3.8\nActivity 3.8\nActivity 3.8\nActivity 3.8\nn\nTake a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder.\nn\nBurn the magnesium ribbon.

For this, collect the samples of following metals –\naluminium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium.\n Most non-metals produce acidic oxides when dissolve in water. On\nthe other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. You will be learning\nmore about these metal oxides in the next section.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n41\n3.2.1 What happens when Metals are burnt in Air?\nYou have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium burns in air with a dazzling\nwhite flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by\nperforming the following Activity.\nActivity 3.9\nActivity 3.9\nActivity 3.9\nActivity 3.9\nActivity 3.9\nCAUTION: The following activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\nIt would be better if students wear eye protection.\nn\nHold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try\nburning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples.\nn\nCollect the product if formed.\nn\nLet the products and the metal surface cool down.\nn\nWhich metals burn easily?\nn\nWhat flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt?\nn\nHow does the metal surface appear after burning?\nn\nArrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity\ntowards oxygen.\nn\nAre the products soluble in water?\nAlmost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides.\nMetal  +  Oxygen → Metal oxide\n For example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen\nto form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide.\n2Cu  +  O2  →  2CuO\n(Copper)\n     (Copper(II) oxide)\nSimilarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide.\n4Al\n+\n3O2 → 2Al2O3\n(Aluminium)\n(Aluminium oxide)\nRecall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.\nWe have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal\noxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as\nbasic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as\nbases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides.\nAluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –\nAl2O3 + 6HCl\n→\n2AlCl3\n+ 3H2O\nAl2O3 + 2NaOH\n→\n2NaAlO2 + H2O\n(Sodium\naluminate)\n Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve\nin water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in\nwater to produce alkalis as follows –\nNa2O(s) + H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)\nK2O(s)\n+ H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n42\nWe have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not react with\noxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.\nDo You Know?\nAnodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\noxide layer thicker.  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer.  This oxide layer can\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.\nBut burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a\nconclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals.\n3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with Water?\nActivity 3.10\nActivity 3.10\nActivity 3.10\nActivity 3.10\nActivity 3.10\nCAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\nn\nCollect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9.\nn\nPut small pieces of the samples separately in beakers half-filled\nwith cold water.\nn\nWhich metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the\nincreasing order of their reactivity with cold water.\nn\nDid any metal produce fire on water?\nn\nDoes any metal start floating after some time?\nn\nPut the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers\nhalf-filled with hot water.\nn\nFor the metals that did not react with hot water, arrange the\napparatus as shown in Fig. 3.3 and observe their reaction with steam.\nn\nWhich metals did not react even with steam?\nn\nArrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with water.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n43\nMetals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen\ngas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form\nmetal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water.\nMetal\n+ Water →Metal oxide + Hydrogen\nMetal oxide + Water →Metal hydroxide\nMetals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In\ncase of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic\nthat the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire.\n2K(s)   + 2H2O(l) → 2KOH(aq)  +  H2(g) + heat energy\n2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g) + heat energy\nThe reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is\nnot sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire.\nCa(s) + 2H2O(l) → Ca(OH)2(aq) + H2(g)\nCalcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed\nstick to the surface of the metal.\nMagnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water\nto form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due\nto the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface.\nMetals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or\nhot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen.\n2Al(s) + 3H2O(g) → Al2O3(s) + 3H2(g)\n3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g) → Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g)\nMetals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all.\n3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids?\nYou have already learnt that metals react with acids to give a salt and\nhydrogen gas.\nFigure 3.3\nFigure 3.3\nFigure 3.3\nFigure 3.3\nFigure 3.3 Action of steam on a metal\n2024-25\n\nScience\n44\nMetal + Dilute acid → Salt + Hydrogen\nBut do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out.\nActivity 3.11\nActivity 3.11\nActivity 3.11\nActivity 3.11\nActivity 3.11\nn\nCollect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again.\nIf the samples are tarnished, rub them clean with sand paper.\nCAUTION: Do not take sodium and potassium as they react\nvigorously even with cold water.\nn\nPut the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute\nhydrochloric acid.\nn\nSuspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are\ndipped in the acid.\nn\nObserve the rate of formation of bubbles carefully.\nn\nWhich metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid?\nn\nWith which metal did you record the highest temperature?\nn\nArrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute\nacids.\nWrite equations for the reactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc\nand iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.\nHydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is\nbecause HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H2 produced to\nwater and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N2O, NO,\nNO2). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute\nHNO3 to evolve H2 gas.\nYou must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of formation\nof bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was\nalso the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the\norder Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and\nthe temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does\nnot react with dilute HCl.\nDo You Know?\nAqua regia, (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated\nhydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve\ngold, even though neither of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia is a highly\ncorrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and\nplatinum.\n3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal\nSalts?\nActivity 3.12\nActivity 3.12\nActivity 3.12\nActivity 3.12\nActivity 3.12\nn\nTake a clean wire of copper and an iron nail.\nn\nPut the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron\nnail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4).\nn\nRecord your observations after 20 minutes.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n45\nn\nIn which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred?\nn\nOn what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken\nplace?\nn\nCan you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10\nand 3.11?\nn\nWrite a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that has taken\nplace.\nn\nName the type of reaction.\nReactive metals can displace less\nreactive metals from their compounds in\nsolution or molten form.\nWe have seen in the previous sections\nthat all metals are not equally reactive. We\nchecked the reactivity of various metals\nwith oxygen, water and acids. But all\nmetals do not react with these reagents.\nSo we were not able to put all the metal\nsamples we had collected in decreasing\norder of their reactivity. Displacement\nreactions studied in Chapter 1 give better\nevidence about the reactivity of metals. It\nis simple and easy if metal A displaces\nmetal B from its solution, it is more reactive than B.\nMetal A + Salt solution of B → Salt solution of A + Metal B\nWhich metal, copper or iron, is more reactive according to your\nobservations in Activity 3.12?\n3.2.5 The Reactivity Series\nThe reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their\ndecreasing activities. After performing displacement experiments\n(Activities 1.9 and 3.12), the following series, (Table 3.2) known as the\nreactivity or activity series has been developed.\nTable 3.2 Activity series : Relative reactivities of metals\nK\nPotassium\nMost reactive\nNa\nSodium\nCa\nCalcium\nMg\nMagnesium\nAl\nAluminium\nZn\nZinc\nReactivity decreases\nFe\nIron\nPb\nLead\n[H]\n[Hydrogen]\nCu\nCopper\nHg\nMercury\nAg\nSilver\nAu\nGold\nLeast reactive\nFigure 3.4\nFigure 3.4\nFigure 3.4\nFigure 3.4\nFigure 3.4\nReaction of metals with\nsalt solutions\n2024-25\n\nScience\n46\n?\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n1.\nWhy is sodium kept immersed in kerosene oil?\n2.\nWrite equations for the reactions of\n(i) iron with steam\n(ii) calcium and potassium with water\n3.\nSamples of four metals A, B, C and D were taken and added to the\nfollowing solution one by one.

Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we\nlearnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We\nlearnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show\nlittle chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell.\nLet us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals.\nWe can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus\nof this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has\nbecome 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation\nNa+. On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell\nUse the Table above to answer the following questions about metals\nA, B, C and D.\n(i)\nWhich is the most reactive metal?\n(ii)\nWhat would you observe if B is added to a solution of Copper(II)\nsulphate?\n(iii)\nArrange the metals A, B, C and D in the order of decreasing\nreactivity.\n4.\nWhich gas is produced when dilute hydrochloric acid is added to a\nreactive metal? Write the chemical reaction when iron reacts with dilute\nH2SO4.\n5.\nWhat would you observe when zinc is added to a solution of iron(II)\nsulphate? Write the chemical reaction that takes place.\nMetal\nIron(II) sulphate\nCopper(II) sulphate\nZinc sulphate\nSilver nitrate\nA\nNo reaction\nDisplacement\nB\nDisplacement\nNo reaction\nC\nNo reaction\nNo reaction\nNo reaction\nDisplacement\nD\nNo reaction\nNo reaction\nNo reaction\nNo reaction\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n47\nand it requires one more electron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine\nwere to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine.\nAfter gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,\nbecause its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L\nand M shells.  This gives us a chloride anion C1–. So both these elements\ncan have a give-and-take relation between them as follows (Fig. 3.5).\nNa\nNa + e\n2,8,1\n2,8\n+\n(Sodium cation)\n→\n–\nCl\n+e\nCl\n2,8,7\n2,8,8\n(Chloride anion)\n–\n–\n→\nFigure 3.5\nFigure 3.5\nFigure 3.5\nFigure 3.5\nFigure 3.5 Formation of sodium chloride\nSodium and chloride ions, being oppositely charged, attract each\nother and are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction to exist as\nsodium chloride (NaCl). It should be noted that sodium chloride does\nnot exist as molecules but aggregates of oppositely charged ions.\nLet us see the formation of one more ionic compound, magnesium\nchloride (Fig. 3.6).\nTable 3.3 Electronic configurations of some elements\nType of\nElement\nAtomic\nNumber of\nelement\nnumber\nelectrons in shells\nK\nL\nM\nN\nNoble gases\nHelium (He)\n2\n2\nNeon (Ne)\n10\n2\n8\nArgon (Ar)\n18\n2\n8\n8\nMetals\nSodium (Na)\n11\n2\n8\n1\nMagnesium (Mg)\n12\n2\n8\n2\nAluminium (Al)\n13\n2\n8\n3\nPotassium (K)\n19\n2\n8\n8\n1\nCalcium (Ca)\n20\n2\n8\n8\n2\nNon-metals\nNitrogen (N)\n7\n2\n5\nOxygen (O)\n8\n2\n6\nFluorine (F)\n9\n2\n7\nPhosphorus (P)\n15\n2\n8\n5\nSulphur (S)\n16\n2\n8\n6\nChlorine (Cl)\n17\n2\n8\n7\n2024-25\n\nScience\n48\nMg\nMg\ne\n2+\n(Magnesium cation)\n→\n\n+ 2\n2 8 2\n2 8\n–\n, ,\n,\nCl\n+e\nCl\n2,8,7\n2,8,8\n(Chloride anion)\n–\n–\n→\n\nFigure 3.6\nFigure 3.6\nFigure 3.6\nFigure 3.6\nFigure 3.6 Formation of magnesium chloride\nThe compounds formed in this manner by the transfer of electrons\nfrom a metal to a non-metal are known as ionic compounds or\nelectrovalent compounds.

Repeat with other samples.\nn\nWhat did you observe? Did the samples impart any colour\nto the flame?

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied.\n(ii)\nMelting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic\nattraction.\n(iii)\nSolubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\n(iv)\nConduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state\nsince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely\ncharged ions are overcome due to the heat. Thus, the ions move\nfreely and conduct electricity.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.

Seawater also contains\nsome soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc.\nThe elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,\nare known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high\npercentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted\nfrom it. These minerals are called ores.\n3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\nYou have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of\nthe activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\n2024-25\n\nScience\n50\nstate. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the\nfree state. Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\n(K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques\nare to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category.\nK\nNa\nCa\nMg\nAl\nZn\nFe\nPb\nCu\nAg\nAu\nReduction using\ncarbon\nFound in native\nstate\nElectrolysis\nFigure 3.9\nFigure 3.9\nFigure 3.9\nFigure 3.9\nFigure 3.9\nActivity series and\nrelated metallurgy\nFigure 3.10\nFigure 3.10\nFigure 3.10\nFigure 3.10\nFigure 3.10 Steps involved in the extraction of metals from ores\n3.4.2 Enrichment of Ores\nOres mined from the earth are usually contaminated with large amounts\nof impurities such as soil, sand, etc., called gangue. The impurities must\nbe removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from\nores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10. Each step is\nexplained in detail in the following sections.\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n51\nused for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences\nbetween the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore.\nDifferent separation techniques are  accordingly employed.\n3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these\nmetals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO). Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury\non further heating.\n2HgS(s) + 3O (g) \n2HgO(s) + 2SO (g)\n2\n2\nHeat\n\n→\n\n2HgO(s)\n2Hg(l) + O (g)\n2\nHeat\n\n→\n\nSimilarly, copper which is found as Cu2S in nature can be obtained\nfrom its ore by just heating in air.\n2Cu S + 3O (g)\n2Cu O(s) + 2SO (g)\n2Cu O + Cu S \n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nHeat\nHeat\n\n→\n\n\n→\n6Cu(s) + SO (g)\n2\n3.4.4 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series\nThe metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron, zinc, lead,\ncopper, are moderately reactive. These are usually present as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting. The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows –\nRoasting\n2ZnS(s) + 3O (g)\n2ZnO(s) + 2SO (g)\n2\n2\nHeat\n\n→\n\nCalcination\nZnCO (s)\nZnO(s) + CO (g)\n3\n2\nHeat\n\n→\n\nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc\noxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc.\nZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g)\nYou are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction\nexplained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds\nis also a reduction process.\nBesides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,\nsometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive\nmetals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing\n2024-25\n\nScience\n52\nagents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their\ncompounds. For example, when manganese dioxide is heated with\naluminium powder, the following reaction takes place –\n3MnO2(s) + 4Al(s) → 3Mn(l) + 2Al2O3(s) + Heat\nCan you identify the substances that are getting oxidised\nand reduced?\nThese displacement reactions are highly exothermic. The\namount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced\nin the molten state. In fact, the reaction of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3)\nwith aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked\nmachine parts. This reaction is known as the thermit reaction.\nFe2O3(s) + 2Al(s) → 2Fe(l) + Al2O3(s) + Heat\n3.4.5 Extracting Metals towards the Top of the\nActivity Series\nThe metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive. They cannot\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The\nreactions are –\nAt cathode\nNa+ + e– →Na\nAt anode\n      2Cl– →Cl2 + 2e–\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of\naluminium oxide.\n3.4.6 Refining of Metals\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes\ndescribed above are not very pure. They contain\nimpurities, which must be removed to obtain pure metals.\nThe most widely used method for refining impure metals\nis electrolytic refining.\nElectrolytic Refining: \nElectrolytic Refining: \nElectrolytic Refining: \nElectrolytic Refining: \nElectrolytic Refining: Many metals, such as copper, zinc,\ntin, nickel, silver, gold, etc., are refined electrolytically. In\nthis process, the impure metal is made the anode and a\nthin strip of pure metal is made the cathode. A solution of\nthe metal salt is used as an electrolyte. The apparatus is\nset up as shown in Fig. 3.12. On passing the current\nthrough the electrolyte, the pure metal from the anode\ndissolves into the electrolyte. An equivalent amount of pure\nFigure 3.11\nFigure 3.11\nFigure 3.11\nFigure 3.11\nFigure 3.11\nThermit process for\njoining railway tracks\nFigure 3.12\nFigure 3.12\nFigure 3.12\nFigure 3.12\nFigure 3.12\nElectrolytic refining of copper.

The soluble\nimpurities go into the solution, whereas, the insoluble impurities settle\ndown at the bottom of the anode and are known as anode mud.\n1.\nDefine the following terms.\n(i)\nMineral\n(ii)  Ore\n(iii)  Gangue\n2.\nName two metals which are found in nature in the free state.\n3.\nWhat chemical process is used for obtaining a metal from its oxide?\nActivity 3.14\nActivity 3.14\nActivity 3.14\nActivity 3.14\nActivity 3.14\nn\nTake three test tubes and place clean iron nails\nin each of them.\nn\nLabel these test tubes A, B and C.

This green\nsubstance is basic copper carbonate.\nn Iron when exposed to moist air for a long time acquires a coating\nof a brown flaky substance called rust.\nLet us find out the conditions under which iron rusts.\nA\nB\nC\n2024-25\n\nScience\n54\nDo You Know?\nPure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for making\njewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver.\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wires together.\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys.\nGalvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out?\nAlloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal.\nWe can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance.\nThe substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature.\nIron pillar at Delhi\nThe wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.  They had\ndeveloped a process which prevented iron from rusting. For\nits quality of rust resistance it has been examined by scientists\nfrom all parts of the world. The iron pillar is 8 m high and\nweighs 6 tonnes (6000 kg).\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\nMetals and Non-metals\n55\nIn which cases will you find displacement reactions taking place?\n2.\nWhich metals do not corrode easily?\n3.\nWhat are alloys?\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nMetallic oxides of zinc, magnesium and copper were heated with the\nfollowing metals.\nMetal\nZinc\nMagnesium\nCopper\nZinc oxide\nMagnesium oxide\nCopper oxide\nWhat you have learnt\nn\nElements can be classified as metals and non-metals.\nn\nMetals are lustrous, malleable, ductile and are good conductors of heat and\nelectricity.

    "jesc107": "How do Organisms\nReproduce?\n7\nCHAPTER\nB\nefore we discuss the mechanisms by which organisms reproduce,\nlet us ask a more basic question – why do organisms reproduce?\nAfter all, reproduction is not necessary to maintain the life of an individual\norganism, unlike the essential life processes such as nutrition,\nrespiration, or excretion. On the other hand, if an individual organism is\ngoing to create more individuals, a lot of its energy will be spent in the\nprocess. So why should an individual organism waste energy on a process\nit does not need to stay alive? It would be interesting to discuss the\npossible answers in the classroom!\nWhatever the answer to this question, it is obvious that we notice\norganisms because they reproduce. If there were to be only one, non-\nreproducing member of a particular kind, it is doubtful that we would\nhave noticed its existence. It is the large numbers of organisms belonging\nto a single species that bring them to our notice. How do we know that\ntwo different individual organisms belong to the same species? Usually,\nwe say this because they look similar to each other. Thus, reproducing\norganisms create new individuals that look very much like themselves.\n7.1 DO ORG\n7.1 DO ORG\n7.1 DO ORG\n7.1 DO ORG\n7.1 DO ORGANISMS CREA\nANISMS CREA\nANISMS CREA\nANISMS CREA\nANISMS CREATE EXA\nTE EXA\nTE EXA\nTE EXA\nTE EXACT COPIES OF\nCT COPIES OF\nCT COPIES OF\nCT COPIES OF\nCT COPIES OF\nTHEMSEL\nTHEMSEL\nTHEMSEL\nTHEMSEL\nTHEMSELVES?\nVES?\nVES?\nVES?\nVES?\nOrganisms look similar because their body designs are similar. If body\ndesigns are to be similar, the blueprints for these designs should be\nsimilar. Thus, reproduction at its most basic level will involve making\ncopies of the blueprints of body design. In Class IX, we learnt that the\nchromosomes in the nucleus of a cell contain information for inheritance\nof features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribo\nNucleic Acid) molecules. The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information\nsource for making proteins. If the information is changed, different\nproteins will be made. Different proteins will eventually lead to altered\nbody designs.\nTherefore, a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA\ncopy. Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA. This\ncreates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell, and they will need to\nbe separated from each other. However, keeping one copy of DNA in the\noriginal cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work,\n2024-25\n\nScience\n114\n?\nbecause the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular\nstructure for maintaining life processes. Therefore, DNA copying is\naccompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus, and\nthen the DNA copies separate, each with its own cellular apparatus.\nEffectively, a cell divides to give rise to two cells.\nThese two cells are of course similar, but are they likely to be\nabsolutely identical? The answer to this question will depend on how\naccurately the copying reactions involved occur. No bio-chemical reaction\nis absolutely reliable. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the process\nof copying the DNA will have some variations each time. As a result, the\nDNA copies generated will be similar, but may not be identical to the\noriginal. Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA\ncopy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits. Such a newborn\ncell will simply die. On the other hand, there could still be many other\nvariations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic\noutcome. Thus, the surviving cells are similar to, but subtly different\nfrom each other. This inbuilt tendency for variation during reproduction\nis the basis for evolution, as we will discuss in the next chapter.\n7.1.1 The Importance of Variation\nPopulations of organisms fill well-defined places, or niches, in the\necosystem, using their ability to reproduce. The consistency of DNA\ncopying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body\ndesign features that allow the organism to use that particular niche.\nReproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species.\nHowever, niches can change because of reasons beyond the control\nof the organisms. Temperatures on earth can go up or down, water levels\ncan vary, or there could be meteorite hits, to think of a few examples. If\na population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche\nand if the niche were drastically altered, the population could be wiped\nout. However, if some variations were to be present in a few individuals\nin these populations, there would be some chance for them to survive.\nThus, if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters,\nand if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming,\nmost of these bacteria would die, but the few variants resistant to heat\nwould survive and grow further. Variation is thus useful for the survival\nof species over time.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n1.\nWhat is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction?\n2.\nWhy is variation beneficial to the species but not necessarily\nfor the individual?\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n115\nFigure 7.1(a)\nFigure 7.1(a)\nFigure 7.1(a)\nFigure 7.1(a)\nFigure 7.1(a) Binary fission in Amoeba\nActivity 7.2\nActivity 7.2\nActivity 7.2\nActivity 7.2\nActivity 7.2\n7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE\n7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE\n7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE\n7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE\n7.2 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE\nORGANISMS\nORGANISMS\nORGANISMS\nORGANISMS\nORGANISMS\nActivity 7.1\nActivity 7.1\nActivity 7.1\nActivity 7.1\nActivity 7.1\nn\nDissolve about 10 gm of sugar in 100 mL of water.\nn\nTake 20 mL of this solution in a test tube and add a pinch of yeast\ngranules to it.\nn\nPut a cotton plug on the mouth of the test tube and keep it in a\nwarm place.\nn\nAfter 1 or 2 hours, put a small drop of yeast culture from the test\ntube on a slide and cover it with a coverslip.\nn\nObserve the slide under a microscope.\nn\nWet a slice of bread, and keep it in a cool, moist and dark place.\nn\nObserve the surface of the slice with a magnifying glass.\nn\nRecord your observations for a week.\nCompare and contrast the ways in which yeast grows in the first\ncase, and how mould grows in the second.\nHaving discussed the context in which reproductive processes work,\nlet us now examine how different organisms actually reproduce. The\nmodes by which various organisms reproduce depend on the body\ndesign of the organisms.\n7.2.1 Fission\nFor unicellular organisms, cell division, or fission, leads to the creation\nof new individuals. Many different patterns of fission have been observed.\nMany bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during\ncell division. In organisms such as Amoeba, the splitting of the two cells\nduring division can take place in any plane.\nActivity 7.3\nActivity 7.3\nActivity 7.3\nActivity 7.3\nActivity 7.3\nn\nObserve a permanent slide of\nAmoeba under a microscope.\nn\nSimilarly \nobserve \nanother\npermanent slide of Amoeba\nshowing binary fission.\nn\nNow, compare the observations of\nboth the slides.\nHowever, some unicellular organisms\nshow somewhat more organisation of their\nbodies, such as is seen in Leishmania (which\ncause kala-azar), which have a whip-like\nstructure at one end of the cell. In such\norganisms, binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation to\nFigure 7.1(b)\nFigure 7.1(b)\nFigure 7.1(b)\nFigure 7.1(b)\nFigure 7.1(b) Binary fission in Leishmania\n  (a)         (b)          (c)          (d)            (e)                        (f)\n2024-25\n\nScience\n116\nthese structures. Other single-celled organisms, such as the malarial\nparasite, Plasmodium, divide into many daughter cells simultaneously\nby multiple fission.\nYeast, on the other hand, can put out small buds that separate and\ngrow further, as we saw in Activity 7.1.\n7.2.2 Fragmentation\nFigure 7.2\nFigure 7.2\nFigure 7.2\nFigure 7.2\nFigure 7.2\nMultiple fission in\nPlasmodium\nActivity 7.4\nActivity 7.4\nActivity 7.4\nActivity 7.4\nActivity 7.4\nn\nCollect water from a lake or pond that appears dark green and\ncontains filamentous structures.\nn\nPut one or two filaments on a slide.\nn\nPut a drop of glycerine on these filaments and cover it with a coverslip.\nn\nObserve the slide under a microscope.\nn\nCan you identify different tissues in the Spirogyra filaments?\nIn multi-cellular organisms with relatively simple body organisation,\nsimple reproductive methods can still work. Spirogyra, for example,\nsimply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation. These pieces or\nfragments grow into new individuals. Can we work out the reason for\nthis, based on what we saw in Activity 7.4?\nThis is not true for all multi-cellular organisms. They cannot simply\ndivide cell-by-cell. The reason is that many multi-cellular organisms, as\nwe have seen, are not simply a random collection of cells. Specialised\ncells are organised as tissues, and tissues are organised into organs,\nwhich then have to be placed at definite positions in the body. In such a\ncarefully organised situation, cell-by-cell division would be impractical.\nMulti-cellular organisms, therefore, need to use more complex ways of\nreproduction.\nA basic strategy used in multi-cellular organisms is that different\ncell types perform different specialised functions. Following this general\npattern, reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific\ncell type. How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type, if\nthe organism itself consists of many cell types? The answer is that there\nmust be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing,\nproliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances.\n7.2.3 Regeneration\nMany fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new\nindividual organisms from their body parts. That is, if the individual is\nsomehow cut or broken up into many pieces, many of these pieces grow\ninto separate individuals. For example, simple animals like Hydra and\nPlanaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows\ninto a complete organism. This is known as regeneration (see Fig. 7.3).\nRegeneration is carried out by specialised cells. These cells proliferate\nand make large numbers of cells. From this mass of cells, different cells\nundergo changes to become various cell types and tissues. These changes\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n117\nFigure 7.3 \nFigure 7.3 \nFigure 7.3 \nFigure 7.3 \nFigure 7.3 Regeneration in Planaria\ntake place in an organised\nsequence referred to as\ndevelopment. \nHowever,\nregeneration is not the same\nas reproduction, since most\norganisms \nwould \nnot\nnormally depend on being cut\nup to be able to reproduce.\n7.2.4 Budding\nOrganisms such as Hydra\nuse regenerative cells for\nreproduction in the process of\nbudding. In Hydra, a bud\ndevelops as an outgrowth due\nto repeated cell division at one\nspecific site (Fig. 7.4). These buds develop into tiny individuals and when\nfully mature, detach from the parent body and become new independent\nindividuals.\nFigure 7.4\nFigure 7.4\nFigure 7.4\nFigure 7.4\nFigure 7.4 Budding in Hydra\n7.2.5 Vegetative Propagation\nThere are many plants in which parts like the root, stem and leaves\ndevelop into new plants under appropriate conditions. Unlike in most\nanimals, plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction. This\nproperty of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering\nor grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane, roses, or grapes for\nagricultural purposes. Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear\nflowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. Such methods\nalso make possible the propagation of plants such as banana, orange,\nrose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds. Another\nadvantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are\ngenetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its\ncharacteristics.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n118\nSimilarly buds produced in the notches along the leaf\nmargin of Bryophyllum fall on the soil and develop into\nnew plants (Fig. 7.5).\nActivity 7.6\nActivity 7.6\nActivity 7.6\nActivity 7.6\nActivity 7.6\nn\nSelect a money-plant.\nn\nCut some pieces such that they contain at least\none leaf.\nn\nCut out some other portions between two leaves.\nn\nDip one end of all the pieces in water and observe\nover the next few days.\nn\nWhich ones grow and give rise to fresh leaves?\nn\nWhat can you conclude from your observations?\nTissue culture\nIn tissue culture, new plants are grown by removing tissue or separating cells from\nthe growing tip of a plant. The cells are then placed in an artificial medium where they\ndivide rapidly to form a small group of cells or callus. The callus is transferred to\nanother medium containing hormones for growth and differentiation. The plantlets\nare then placed in the soil so that they can grow into mature plants. Using tissue\nculture, many plants can be grown from one parent in disease-free conditions. This\ntechnique is commonly used for ornamental plants.\n7.2.6 Spore Formation\nEven in many simple multi-cellular organisms, specific reproductive\nparts can be identified. The thread-like structures that developed on\nthe bread in Activity 7.2 above are the hyphae of the bread mould\n(Rhizopus). They are not reproductive parts. On the other hand, the\ntiny blob-on-a-stick structures are involved in reproduction. The\nblobs are sporangia, which contain cells, or spores, that can\neventually develop into new Rhizopus individuals (Fig. 7.6). The spores\nare covered by thick walls that protect them until they come into\ncontact with another moist surface and can begin to grow.\nFigure 7.6\nFigure 7.6\nFigure 7.6\nFigure 7.6\nFigure 7.6\nSpore formation in Rhizopus\nActivity 7.5\nActivity 7.5\nActivity 7.5\nActivity 7.5\nActivity 7.5\nn\nTake a potato and observe its surface.

This is known as\nasexual reproduction.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nHow does binary fission differ from multiple fission?\n2.\nHow will an organism be benefited if it reproduces through spores?\n3.\nCan you think of reasons why more complex organisms cannot give\nrise to new individuals through regeneration?\n4.\nWhy is vegetative propagation practised for growing some types of\nplants?\n5.\nWhy is DNA copying an essential part of the process of reproduction?\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\n7.3 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION\nWe are also familiar with modes of reproduction that depend on the\ninvolvement of two individuals before a new generation can be created.\nBulls alone cannot produce new calves, nor can hens alone produce\nnew chicks. In such cases, both sexes, males and females, are needed to\nproduce new generations. What is the significance of this sexual mode\nof reproduction? Are there any limitations of the asexual mode of\nreproduction, which we have been discussing above?\n7.3.1 Why the Sexual Mode of Reproduction?\nThe creation of two new cells from one involves copying of the DNA as\nwell as of the cellular apparatus. The DNA copying mechanism, as we\nhave noted, cannot be absolutely accurate, and the resultant errors are\na source of variations in populations of organisms. Every individual\norganism cannot be protected by variations, but in a population,\nvariations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species. It would\ntherefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes\nthat allowed more and more variation to be generated.\nWhile DNA-copying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate, they\nare precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow\nprocess. If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate, many\nof the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular\napparatus, and would die. So how can the process of making variants\nbe speeded up? Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already\nhas variations accumulated from previous generations. Thus, two\ndifferent individuals in a population would have quite different patterns\nof accumulated variations. Since all of these variations are in living\nindividuals, it is assured that they do not have any really bad effects.\nCombining variations from two or more individuals would thus create\nnew combinations of variants. Each combination would be novel, since\nit would involve two different individuals. The sexual mode of\n2024-25\n\nScience\n120\nreproduction incorporates such a process of combining DNA from two\ndifferent individuals during reproduction.\nBut this creates a major difficulty. If each new generation is to be the\ncombination of the DNA copies from two pre-existing individuals, then\neach new generation will end up having twice the amount of DNA that\nthe previous generation had. This is likely to mess up the control of the\ncellular apparatus by the DNA. How many ways can we think of for\nsolving this difficulty?\nWe have seen earlier that as organisms become more complex, the\nspecialisation of tissue increases. One solution that many multi-cellular\norganisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special\nlineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of\nchromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non-\nreproductive body cells. This is achieved by a process of cell division\ncalled meiosis. Thus, when these germ-cells from two individuals combine\nduring sexual reproduction to form a new individual, it results in re-\nestablishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in\nthe new generation.\nIf the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has\nhighly specialised tissues and organs, then it has to have sufficient stores\nof energy for doing this. In very simple organisms, it is seen that the two\ngerm-cells are not very different from one another, or may even be similar.\nBut as the body designs become more complex, the germ-cells also\nspecialise. One germ-cell is large and contains the food-stores while the\nother is smaller and likely to be motile. Conventionally, the motile germ-\ncell is called the male gamete and the germ-cell containing the stored\nfood is called the female gamete. We shall see in the next few sections\nhow the need to create these two different types of gametes give rise to\ndifferences in the male and female reproductive organs and, in some\ncases, differences in the bodies of the male and female organisms.\n7.3.2 Sexual Reproduction in Flowering Plants\nThe reproductive parts of angiosperms are located in the flower. You\nhave already studied the different parts of a flower – sepals, petals,\nstamens and pistil. Stamens and pistil are\nthe reproductive parts of a flower which\ncontain the germ-cells. What possible\nfunctions could the petals and sepals serve?\nThe flower may be unisexual (papaya,\nwatermelon) when it contains either stamens\nor pistil or bisexual (Hibiscus, mustard)\nwhen it contains both stamens and pistil.\nStamen is the male reproductive part and it\nproduces pollen grains that are yellowish\nin colour. You must have seen this yellowish\npowder that often sticks to our hands if we\ntouch the stamen of a flower. Pistil is present\nin the centre of a flower and is the female\nreproductive part. It is made of three parts.\nFigure 7.7\nFigure 7.7\nFigure 7.7\nFigure 7.7\nFigure 7.7\nLongitudinal section of\nflower\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n121\nFigure 7.8\nFigure 7.8\nFigure 7.8\nFigure 7.8\nFigure 7.8\nGermination of pollen on\nstigma\nThe swollen bottom part is the ovary, middle elongated part is the style\nand the terminal part which may be sticky is the stigma. The ovary\ncontains ovules and each ovule has an egg cell. The male germ-cell\nproduced by pollen grain fuses with the female gamete present in\nthe ovule. This fusion of the germ-cells or fertilisation gives us the\nzygote which is capable of growing into a new plant.\nThus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the\nstigma. If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower, it is\nreferred to as self-pollination. On the other hand, if the pollen is\ntransferred from one flower to another, it is known as cross-\npollination. This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is\nachieved by agents like wind, water or animals.\nAfter the pollen lands on a suitable stigma, it has to reach the\nfemale germ-cells which are in the ovary. For this, a tube grows\nout of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the\novary.\nAfter fertilisation, the zygote divides several times to form an\nembryo within the ovule. The ovule develops a tough coat and is\ngradually converted into a seed. The ovary grows rapidly and ripens\nto form a fruit. Meanwhile, the petals, sepals, stamens, style and\nstigma may shrivel and fall off. Have you ever observed any flower\npart still persisting in the fruit? Try and work out the advantages\nof seed-formation for the plant. The seed contains the future plant\nor embryo which develops into a seedling under appropriate\nconditions. This process is known as germination.\nActivity 7.7\nActivity 7.7\nActivity 7.7\nActivity 7.7\nActivity 7.7\nn\nSoak a few seeds of Bengal gram (chana)\nand keep them overnight.\nn\nDrain the excess water and cover the seeds\nwith a wet cloth and leave them for a day.\nMake sure that the seeds do not become dry.\nn\nCut open the seeds carefully and observe\nthe different parts.\nn\nCompare your observations with the Fig. 7.9\nand see if you can identify all the parts.\n7.3.3 Reproduction in Human Beings\nSo far, we have been discussing the variety of modes that different species\nuse for reproduction. Let us now look at the species that we are most\ninterested in, namely, humans. Humans use a sexual mode of\nreproduction. How does this process work?\nLet us begin at an apparently unrelated point. All of us know that\nour bodies change as we become older. You have learnt changes that\ntake place in your body earlier in Class VIII also. We notice that our\nheight has increased continuously from early age till now. We acquire\nteeth, we even lose the old, so-called milk teeth and acquire new ones.\nFigure 7.9\nFigure 7.9\nFigure 7.9\nFigure 7.9\nFigure 7.9\nGermination\n2024-25\n\nScience\n122\nAll of these are changes that can be grouped under the general process\nof growth, in which the body becomes larger. But in early teenage years,\na whole new set of changes occurs that cannot be explained simply as\nbody enlargement. Instead, the appearance of the body changes.\nProportions change, new features appear, and so do new sensations.\nSome of these changes are common to both boys and girls. We begin\nto notice thick hair growing in new parts of the body such as armpits\nand the genital area between the thighs, which can also become darker\nin colour. Thinner hair can also appear on legs and arms, as well as on\nthe face. The skin frequently becomes oily and we might begin to develop\npimples. We begin to be conscious and aware of both our own bodies\nand those of others in new ways.\nOn the other hand, there are also changes taking place that are\ndifferent between boys and girls. In girls, breast size begins to increase,\nwith darkening of the skin of the nipples at the tips of the breasts. Also,\ngirls begin to menstruate at around this time. Boys begin to have new\nthick hair growth on the face and their voices begin to crack. Further,\nthe penis occasionally begins to become enlarged and erect, either in\ndaydreams or at night.\nAll of these changes take place slowly, over a period of months and\nyears. They do not happen all at the same time in one person, nor do\nthey happen at an exact age. In some people, they happen early and\nquickly, while in others, they can happen slowly. Also, each change does\nnot become complete quickly either. So, for example, thick hair on the\nface in boys appears as a few scattered hairs first, and only slowly does\nthe growth begin to become uniform. Even so, all these changes show\ndifferences between people. Just as we have differently shaped noses or\nfingers, so also we have different patterns of hair growth, or size and\nshape of breast or penis. All of these changes are aspects of the sexual\nmaturation of the body.\nWhy does the body show sexual maturation at this age? We have\ntalked about the need for specialised cell types in multi-cellular bodies\nto carry out specialised functions. The creation of germ-cells to participate\nin sexual reproduction is another specialised function, and we have seen\nthat plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them. Human\nbeings also develop special tissues for this purpose. However, while the\nbody of the individual organism is growing to its adult size, the resources\nof the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth. While that is\nhappening, the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be\na major priority. Thus, as the rate of general body growth begins to slow\ndown, reproductive tissues begin to mature. This period during\nadolescence is called puberty.\nSo how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the\nreproductive process? We must remember that the sexual mode of\nreproduction means that germ-cells from two individuals have to join\ntogether. This can happen by the external release of germ-cells from the\nbodies of individuals, as happens in flowering plants. Or it can happen\nby two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of\ngerm-cells for fusion, as happens in many animals. If animals are to\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n123\nparticipate in this process of mating, their state of sexual maturity must\nbe identifiable by other individuals. Many changes during puberty, such\nas new hair-growth patterns, are signals that sexual maturation is taking\nplace.\nOn the other hand, the actual transfer of germ-cells between two\npeople needs special organs for the sexual act, such as the penis when it\nis capable of becoming erect. In mammals such as humans, the baby is\ncarried in the mother’s body for a long period, and will be breast-fed\nlater. The female reproductive organs and breasts will need to mature to\naccommodate these possibilities. Let us look at the systems involved in\nthe process of sexual reproduction.\n7.3.3 (a) Male Reproductive System\nThe male reproductive system (Fig. 7.10)\nconsists of portions which produce the\ngerm-cells and other portions that deliver\nthe germ-cells to the site of fertilisation.\nThe formation of germ-cells or sperms\ntakes place in the testes. These are located\noutside the abdominal cavity in scrotum\nbecause sperm formation requires a lower\ntemperature than the normal body\ntemperature. We have discussed the role of the\ntestes in the secretion of the hormone,\ntestosterone, in the previous chapter. In\naddition to regulating the formation of sperms,\ntestosterone brings about changes in\nappearance seen in boys at the time of puberty.\nThe sperms formed are delivered\nthrough the vas deferens which unites with\na tube coming from the urinary bladder. The\nurethra thus forms a common passage for\nboth the sperms and urine. Along the path\nof the vas deferens, glands like the prostate\nand the seminal vesicles add their secretions\nso that the sperms are now in a fluid which\nmakes their transport easier and this fluid\nalso provides nutrition. The sperms are tiny\nbodies that consist of mainly genetic\nmaterial and a long tail that helps them to\nmove towards the female germ-cell.\n7.3.3 (b) Female Reproductive System\nThe female germ-cells or eggs are made in\nthe ovaries. They are also responsible for the\nproduction of some hormones. Look at\nFig. 7.11 and identify the various organs in\nthe female reproductive system.\nFigure 7.10 \nFigure 7.10 \nFigure 7.10 \nFigure 7.10 \nFigure 7.10 Human–male reproductive system\nFigure 7.11 \nFigure 7.11 \nFigure 7.11 \nFigure 7.11 \nFigure 7.11 Human –female reproductive system\n2024-25\n\nScience\n124\nWhen a girl is born, the ovaries already contain thousands of\nimmature eggs. On reaching puberty, some of these start maturing. One\negg is produced every month by one of the ovaries. The egg is carried\nfrom the ovary to the womb through a thin oviduct or fallopian tube.\nThe two oviducts unite into an elastic bag-like structure known as the\nuterus. The uterus opens into the vagina through the cervix.\nThe sperms enter through the vaginal passage during sexual\nintercourse. They travel upwards and reach the oviduct where they may\nencounter the egg. The fertilised egg (zygote) starts dividing and form a\nball of cells or embryo. The embryo is implanted in the lining of the uterus\nwhere they continue to grow and develop organs to become foetus. We\nhave seen in earlier sections that the mother’s body is designed to\nundertake the development of the child. Hence the uterus prepares itself\nevery month to receive and nurture the growing embryo. The lining\nthickens and is richly supplied with blood to nourish the growing embryo.\nThe embryo gets nutrition from the mother’s blood with the help of a\nspecial tissue called placenta. This is a disc which is embedded in the\nuterine wall. It contains villi on the embryo’s side of the tissue. On the\nmother’s side are blood spaces, which surround the villi. This provides\na large surface area for glucose and oxygen to pass from the mother to\nthe embryo. The developing embryo will also generate waste substances\nwhich can be removed by transferring them into the mother’s blood\nthrough the placenta. The development of the child inside the mother’s\nbody takes approximately nine months. The child is born as a result of\nrhythmic contractions of the muscles in the uterus.\n7.3.3 (c) What happens when the Egg is not Fertilised?\nIf the egg is not fertilised, it lives for about one day. Since the ovary\nreleases one egg every month, the uterus also prepares itself every month\nto receive a fertilised egg. Thus its lining becomes thick and spongy.\nThis would be required for nourishing the embryo if fertilisation had\ntaken place. Now, however, this lining is not needed any longer. So, the\nlining slowly breaks and comes out through the vagina as blood and\nmucous. This cycle takes place roughly every month and is known as\nmenstruation. It usually lasts for about two to eight days.\n7.3.3 (d) Reproductive Health\nAs we have seen, the process of sexual maturation is gradual, and takes\nplace while general body growth is still going on. Therefore, some degree\nof sexual maturation does not necessarily mean that the body or the\nmind is ready for sexual acts or for having and bringing up children.\nHow do we decide if the body or the mind is ready for this major\nresponsibility? All of us are under many different kinds of pressures\nabout these issues. There can be pressure from our friends for\nparticipating in many activities, whether we really want to or not. There\ncan be pressure from families to get married and start having children.\nThere can be pressure from government agencies to avoid having\nchildren. In this situation, making choices can become very difficult.\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n125\nWe must also consider the possible health consequences of having\nsex. We have discussed in Class IX that diseases can be transmitted\nfrom person to person in a variety of ways. Since the sexual act is a\nvery intimate connection of bodies, it is not surprising that many\ndiseases can be sexually transmitted. These include bacterial infections\nsuch as gonorrhoea and syphilis, and viral infections such as warts\nand HIV-AIDS. Is it possible to prevent the transmission of such diseases\nduring the sexual act? Using a covering, called a condom, for the penis\nduring sex helps to prevent transmission of many of these infections to\nsome extent.\nThe sexual act always has the potential to lead to pregnancy.\nPregnancy will make major demands on the body and the mind of the\nwoman, and if she is not ready for it, her health will be adversely\naffected. Therefore, many ways have been devised to avoid pregnancy.\nThese contraceptive methods fall in a number of categories. One\ncategory is the creation of a mechanical barrier so that sperm does not\nreach the egg. Condoms on the penis or similar coverings worn in the\nvagina can serve this purpose. Another category of contraceptives acts\nby changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not\nreleased and fertilisation cannot occur. These drugs commonly need\nto be taken orally as pills. However, since they change hormonal\nbalances, they can cause side-effects too. Other contraceptive devices\nsuch as the loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to prevent\npregnancy. Again, they can cause side effects due to irritation of the\nuterus. If the vas deferens in the male is blocked, sperm transfer will\nbe prevented. If the fallopian tube in the female is blocked, the egg will\nnot be able to reach the uterus. In both cases fertilisation will not take\nplace. Surgical methods can be used to create such blocks. While\nsurgical methods are safe in the long run, surgery itself can cause\ninfections and other problems if not performed properly. Surgery can\nalso be used for removal of unwanted pregnancies. These may be\nmisused by people who do not want a particular child, as happens in\nillegal sex-selective abortion of female foetuses. For a healthy society,\nthe female-male sex ratio must be maintained. Because of reckless\nfemale foeticides, child sex ratio is declining at an alarming rate in\nsome sections of our society, although prenatal sex determination has\nbeen prohibited by law.\nWe have noted earlier that reproduction is the process by which\norganisms increase their populations. The rates of birth and death in a\ngiven population will determine its size. The size of the human population\nis a cause for concern for many people. This is because an expanding\npopulation makes it harder to improve everybody’s standard of living.\nHowever, if inequality in society is the main reason for poor standards of\nliving for many people, the size of the population is relatively unimportant.\nIf we look around us, what can we identify as the most important\nreason(s) for poor living standards?\n2024-25\n\nScience\n126\nWhat you have learnt\nn\nReproduction, unlike other life processes, is not essential to maintain the life of an\nindividual organism.\nn\nReproduction involves creation of a DNA copy and additional cellular apparatus\nby the cell involved in the process.\nn\nVarious organisms use different modes of reproduction depending on their body\ndesign.\nn\nIn fission, many bacteria and protozoa simply divide into two or more daughter\ncells.\nn\nOrganisms such as hydra can regenerate if they are broken into pieces. They can\nalso give out buds which mature into new individuals.\nn\nRoots, stems and leaves of some plants develop into new plants through vegetative\npropagation.\nn\nThese are examples of asexual reproduction where new generations are created\nfrom a single individual.\nn\nSexual reproduction involves two individuals for the creation of a new individual.\nn\nDNA copying mechanisms creates variations which are useful for ensuring the\nsurvival of the species. Modes of sexual reproduction allow for greater variation to\nbe generated.\nn\nReproduction in flowering plants involves transfer of pollen grains from the anther\nto the stigma which is referred to as pollination. This is followed by fertilisation.\nn\nChanges in the body at puberty, such as increase in breast size in girls and new\nfacial hair growth in boys, are signs of sexual maturation.\nn\nThe male reproductive system in human beings consists of testes which produce\nsperms, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, urethra and penis.\nn\nThe female reproductive system in human beings consists of ovaries, fallopian\ntubes, uterus and vagina.\nn\nSexual reproduction in human beings involves the introduction of sperm in the\nvagina of the female. Fertilisation occurs in the fallopian tube.\nn\nContraception to avoid pregnancy can be achieved by the use of condoms, oral\npills, copper-T and other methods.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nHow is the process of pollination different from fertilisation?\n2.\nWhat is the role of the seminal vesicles and the prostate gland?\n3.\nWhat are the changes seen in girls at the time of puberty?\n4.\nHow does the embryo get nourishment inside the mother’s body?\n5.\nIf a woman is using a copper-T, will it help in protecting her from\nsexually transmitted diseases?\n2024-25\n\nHow do Organisms Reproduce?\n127\nE\nX\nE\nR\nC\nI\nS\nE\nS\n1.\nAsexual reproduction takes place through budding in\n(a)\nAmoeba.\n(b)\nYeast.\n(c)\nPlasmodium.\n(d)\nLeishmania.\n2.\nWhich of the following is not a part of the female reproductive system in human\nbeings?\n(a)\nOvary\n(b)\nUterus\n(c)\nVas deferens\n(d)\nFallopian tube\n3.\nThe anther contains\n(a)\nsepals.\n(b)\novules.\n(c)\npistil.\n(d)\npollen grains.\n4.\nWhat are the advantages of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction?\n5.\nWhat are the functions performed by the testis in human beings?\n6.\nWhy does menstruation occur?\n7.\nDraw a labelled diagram of the longitudinal section of a flower.\n8.\nWhat are the different methods of contraception?\n9.\nHow are the modes for reproduction different in unicellular and\nmulticellular organisms?\n10.

Then, what about the reverse possibility of an electric effect of\nmoving magnets? In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such\nelectromagnetic effects. We shall also study about electromagnets which\ninvolve the magnetic effect of electric current.\nHans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)\nHans Christian Oersted, one of the leading scientists of the 19th\ncentury, played a crucial role in understanding electromagnetism. In\n1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected\nwhen an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby.\nThrough this observation Oersted showed that electricity and\nmagnetism were related phenomena. His research later created\ntechnologies such as the radio, television and fiber optics. The unit of\nmagnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.\nResistor\nLong straight\nconductor\n2024-25\n\nScience\n196\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\n12.1 MAGNETIC FIELD AND FIELD LINES\nWe are familiar with the fact that a compass needle gets deflected when\nbrought near a bar magnet. A compass needle is, in fact, a small bar\nmagnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards\nnorth and south directions. The end pointing towards north is called north\nseeking or north pole. The other end that points towards south is called\nsouth seeking or south pole. Through various activities we have observed\nthat like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\n?\n1.\nWhy does a compass needle get deflected when brought near\na bar magnet?\nActivity 12.2\nActivity 12.2\nActivity 12.2\nActivity 12.2\nActivity 12.2\nn\nFix a sheet of white paper on a drawing\nboard using some adhesive material.\nn\nPlace a bar magnet in the centre of it.\nn\nSprinkle some iron filings uniformly\naround the bar magnet (Fig. 12.2).

Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What does\nthis pattern demonstrate?  The magnet exerts its influence in the region\nsurrounding it.  Therefore the iron filings experience a force.  The force\nthus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field.  The lines along which the iron filings\nalign themselves represent magnetic field lines.\nAre there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar\nmagnet?  Yes, you can yourself draw the field lines of a bar magnet.\nActivity 12.3\nActivity 12.3\nActivity 12.3\nActivity 12.3\nActivity 12.3\nn\nTake a small compass and a bar magnet.\nn\nPlace the magnet on a sheet of white paper fixed on a drawing\nboard, using some adhesive material.\nn\nMark the boundary of the magnet.\nn\nPlace the compass near the north pole of the magnet.

The north pole of the compass is directed\naway from the north pole of the magnet.\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n197\nMagnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude.\nThe direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a\nnorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it.  Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4).\nInside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves.\nThe relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines. The field is stronger, that is, the force acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4).\nNo two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would\nmean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point\ntowards two directions, which is not possible.\n12.2\n12.2\n12.2\n12.2\n12.2 MA\nMA\nMA\nMA\nMAGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT\nGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT\nGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT\nGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT\nGNETIC FIELD DUE TO A CURRENT-----CCCCCARRYING\nARRYING\nARRYING\nARRYING\nARRYING\nCONDUCTOR\nCONDUCTOR\nCONDUCTOR\nCONDUCTOR\nCONDUCTOR\nIn Activity 12.1, we have seen that an electric current through a\nmetallic conductor produces a magnetic field around it. In order to\nfind the direction of the field produced let us repeat the activity in the\nfollowing way –\nFigure 12.3\nFigure 12.3\nFigure 12.3\nFigure 12.3\nFigure 12.3\nDrawing a magnetic field line with the help of a\ncompass needle\nn\nMark the position of two ends of the needle.\nn\nNow move the needle to a new position\nsuch that its south pole occupies the\nposition previously occupied by its north\npole.\nn\nIn this way, proceed step by step till you\nreach the south pole of the magnet as\nshown in Fig. 12.3.\nn\nJoin the points marked on the paper by a\nsmooth curve.  This curve represents\na field line.\nn\nRepeat the above procedure and draw as\nmany lines as you can. You will get a\npattern shown in Fig. 12.4. These lines\nrepresent the magnetic field around the\nmagnet. These are known as magnetic\nfield lines.\nn\nObserve the deflection in the compass\nneedle as you move it along a field line.\nThe deflection increases as the needle is\nmoved towards the poles.\nFigure 12.4\nFigure 12.4\nFigure 12.4\nFigure 12.4\nFigure 12.4\nField lines around a bar magnet\n2024-25\n\nScience\n198\n12.2.1 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Straight\nConductor\nWhat determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a current\nthrough a conductor? Does the pattern depend on the shape of the\nconductor? We shall investigate this with an activity.\nWe shall first consider the pattern of the magnetic field around a\nstraight conductor carrying current.\nActivity 12.4\nActivity 12.4\nActivity 12.4\nActivity 12.4\nActivity 12.4\nn\nTake a long straight copper wire, two or three cells of 1.5 V each, and a plug key. Connect\nall of them in series as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a).\nn\nPlace the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle.\nn\nPlug the key in the circuit.\nn\nObserve the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle. If the current flows from\nnorth to south, as shown in Fig. 12.5 (a), the north pole of the compass needle would move\ntowards the east.\nn\nReplace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig. 12.5 (b). This would result in\nthe change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to\nnorth.\nn\nObserve the change in the direction of deflection of the needle. You will see that now the\nneedle moves in opposite direction, that is, towards the west [Fig. 12.5 (b)]. It means that\nthe direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed.\nFigure 12.5\nFigure 12.5\nFigure 12.5\nFigure 12.5\nFigure 12.5 A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass\nneedle.

Take care that the cardboard is fixed and\ndoes not slide up or down.\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n199\nWhat happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a\ngiven point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary\nthe current in the wire. We find that the deflection in the needle also\nchanges. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases.\nIt indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases.\nWhat happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the\nconducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see\nthat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance\nfrom it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentric\ncircles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight\nwire become larger and larger as we move away from it.\n12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule\nA convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated\nwith a current-carrying conductor is given in Fig. 12.7.\nn\nConnect the copper wire vertically between the\npoints X and Y, as shown in Fig. 12.6 (a), in\nseries with the battery, a plug and key.\nn\nSprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the\ncardboard. (You may use a salt sprinkler for this\npurpose.)\nn\nKeep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed\nposition and note the current through the\nammeter.\nn\nClose the key so that a current flows through\nthe wire. Ensure that the copper wire placed\nbetween the points X and Y remains vertically\nstraight.\nn\nGently tap the cardboard a few times. Observe\nthe pattern of the iron filings. You would find\nthat the iron filings align themselves showing\na pattern of concentric circles around the\ncopper wire (Fig. 12.6).\nn\nWhat do these concentric circles represent?\nThey represent the magnetic field lines.\nn\nHow can the direction of the magnetic field be\nfound? Place a compass at a point (say P) over\na circle. Observe the direction of the needle. The\ndirection of the north pole of the compass\nneedle would give the direction of the field lines\nproduced by the electric current through the\nstraight wire at point P. Show the direction by\nan arrow.\nn\nDoes the direction of magnetic field lines get\nreversed if the direction of current through the\nstraight copper wire is reversed? Check it.\nFigure 12.6\nFigure 12.6\nFigure 12.6\nFigure 12.6\nFigure 12.6\n(a) A pattern of concentric circles indicating\nthe field lines of a magnetic field around a\nstraight conducting wire.

Then your fingers will wrap around the\nconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as\nshown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*.\nExample 12.1\nA current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west\ndirection. What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it?\nSolution\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end.\nFigure 12.7\nFigure 12.7\nFigure 12.7\nFigure 12.7\nFigure 12.7\nRight-hand thumb rule\n* This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a\ncorkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of\ncorkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field.\n12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a\nCircular Loop\nWe have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines\nproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nappear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\ncurrent would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop.\nFigure 12.8\nFigure 12.8\nFigure 12.8\nFigure 12.8\nFigure 12.8\nMagnetic field lines of the field\nproduced by a current-carrying\ncircular loop\n?\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n1.\nDraw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet.\n2.\nList the properties of magnetic field lines.\n3.\nWhy don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other?\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n201\nWe know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying\nwire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it.\nTherefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is\nn times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the\ncurrent in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to\neach turn then just adds up.\nActivity 12.6\nActivity 12.6\nActivity 12.6\nActivity 12.6\nActivity 12.6\nn\nTake a rectangular cardboard having two holes.\nInsert a circular coil having large number of turns\nthrough them, normal to the plane of the cardboard.\nn\nConnect the ends of the coil in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat, as shown in Fig. 12.9.\nn\nSprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard.\nn\nPlug the key.\nn\nTap the cardboard gently a few times. Note the\npattern of the iron filings that emerges on the\ncardboard.\nFigure 12.9\nFigure 12.9\nFigure 12.9\nFigure 12.9\nFigure 12.9\nMagnetic field produced by a current-\ncarrying circular coil.\n12.2.4 Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid\nA coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped\nclosely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid. The pattern\nof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is\nshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the\nmagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look\nsimilar? Yes, they are similar. In fact, one end of the solenoid\nbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of\nparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is\nthe same at all points inside the solenoid. That is, the field is\nuniform inside the solenoid.\nA strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be\nused to magnetise a piece of magnetic material, like soft iron,\nwhen placed inside the coil (Fig. 12.11). The magnet so formed is\ncalled an electromagnet.\nFigure 12.10\nFigure 12.10\nFigure 12.10\nFigure 12.10\nFigure 12.10\nField lines of the magnetic field\nthrough and around a current\ncarrying solenoid.\nFigure 12.11\nFigure 12.11\nFigure 12.11\nFigure 12.11\nFigure 12.11\nA current-carrying solenoid coil\nis used to magnetise steel rod\ninside it – an electromagnet.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nConsider a circular loop of wire lying in\nthe plane of the table.

The field so produced exerts a force on a\nmagnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor. French scientist Andre\nMarie Ampere (1775–1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert\nan equal and opposite force on the current-carrying conductor. The force\ndue to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be\ndemonstrated through the following activity.\n3.\nChoose the correct option.\nThe magnetic field inside a long straight solenoid-carrying current\n(a)\nis zero.\n(b)\ndecreases as we move towards its end.\n(c)\nincreases as we move towards its end.\n(d)\nis the same at all points.\nActivity 12.7\nActivity 12.7\nActivity 12.7\nActivity 12.7\nActivity 12.7\nn\nTake a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm).

For this put the north pole of\nthe magnet vertically below and south pole vertically\nabove the aluminium rod (Fig. 12.12).\nn\nConnect the aluminium rod in series with a battery,\na key and a rheostat.\nn\nNow pass a current through the aluminium rod from\nend B to end A.\nn\nWhat do you observe? It is observed that the rod is\ndisplaced towards the left. You will notice that the rod\ngets displaced.\nn\nReverse the direction of current flowing through the\nrod and observe the direction of its displacement.

Support for the\nmagnet is not shown here, for simplicity.\nThe displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a\nforce is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed\nin a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also\nreversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed.\nNow change the direction of field to vertically downwards by\ninterchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n203\nthe direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor.\nIn Activity 12.7, we considered the\ndirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and found\nthat the force is perpendicular to both of them.\nThe three directions can be illustrated through\na simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule.\nAccording to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left hand\nsuch that they are mutually perpendicular\n(Fig. 12.13). If the first finger points in the\ndirection of magnetic field and the second\nfinger in the direction of current, then the\nthumb will point in the direction of motion or\nthe force acting on the conductor.\nDevices that use current-carrying conductors and magnetic fields\ninclude electric motor, electric generator, loudspeakers, microphones\nand measuring instruments.\nExample 12.2\nAn electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it, as shown\nin Fig. 12.14. The direction of force acting on the electron will be\n(a)\nto the right.\n(b)\nto the left.\n(c)\nout of the page.\n(d)\ninto the page.\nSolution\nAnswer is option (d). The direction of force is perpendicular to the\ndirection of magnetic field and current as given by Fleming’s left hand\nrule. Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction\nof motion of electrons. The force is therefore directed into the page.\nFigure 12.13\nFigure 12.13\nFigure 12.13\nFigure 12.13\nFigure 12.13\nFleming’s left-hand rule\nFigure 12.14\nFigure 12.14\nFigure 12.14\nFigure 12.14\nFigure 12.14\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhich of the following property of a proton can change while it moves\nfreely in a magnetic field?

One of the wires in this supply, usually with\nred insulation cover, is called live wire (or positive). Another wire, with\nblack insulation, is called neutral wire (or negative). In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V.\nAt the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse. Through the main switch they are connected\nto the line wires in the house. These wires supply electricity to separate\ncircuits within the house. Often, two separate circuits are used, one of\n15 A current rating for appliances with higher power ratings such as\ngeysers, air coolers, etc. The other circuit is of 5 A current rating for\nbulbs, fans, etc. The earth wire, which has insulation of green colour, is\nusually connected to a metal plate deep in the earth near the house.\nThis is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current. Thus, it\nensures that any leakage of current to the metallic body of the appliance\nkeeps its potential to that of the earth, and the user may not get a severe\nelectric shock.\n2.\nIn Activity 12.7, how do we think the displacement of rod AB will be\naffected if (i) current in rod AB is increased; (ii) a stronger horse-shoe\nmagnet is used; and (iii) length of the rod AB is increased?\n3.\nA positively-charged particle (alpha-particle) projected towards west is\ndeflected towards north by a magnetic field.

Even weak ion currents that\ntravel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields. When we touch\nsomething, our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use. This\nimpulse produces a temporary magnetic field. These fields are very weak and are\nabout one-billionth of the earth’s magnetic field. Two main organs in the human\nbody where the magnetic field produced is significant, are the heart and the brain. The\nmagnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body\nparts. This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Analysis\nof these images helps in medical diagnosis. Magnetism has, thus, got important uses\nin medicine.\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n205\nFigure 12.15\nFigure 12.15\nFigure 12.15\nFigure 12.15\nFigure 12.15 A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\nFigure 12.15 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common\ndomestic circuits. In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other.\nElectric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit.\nOverloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket.\n1.\nName two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and\nappliances.\n2.\nAn electric oven of 2 kW power rating is operated in a domestic electric\ncircuit (220 V) that has a current rating of 5 A.

Its one end, which points towards north, is\ncalled a north pole, and the other end, which points towards south, is called a\nsouth pole.\nn\nA magnetic field exists in the region surrounding a magnet, in which the force of\nthe magnet can be detected.\nn\nField lines are used to represent a magnetic field. A field line is the path along\nwhich a hypothetical free north pole would tend to move. The direction of the\nmagnetic field at a point is given by the direction that a north pole placed at that\npoint would take. Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is\ngreater.\nn\nA metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field.\nThe field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction\nis given by the right-hand rule.\nn\nThe pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current\nflowing through it depends on the shape of the conductor. The magnetic field of a\nsolenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet.\nn\nAn electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of\ninsulated copper wire.\nn\nA current-carrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force.\nIf the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to\neach other, then the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both\nand will be given by Fleming’s left-hand rule.\nn\nIn our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz. One\nof the wires in this supply is with red insulation, called live wire. The other one is of\nblack insulation, which is a neutral wire. The potential difference between the two\nis 220 V. The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected\nto a metallic body deep inside earth. It is used as a safety measure to ensure that\nany leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user.\nn\nFuse is the most important safety device, used for protecting the circuits due to\nshort-circuiting or overloading of the circuits.\n2024-25\n\nMagnetic Effects of Electric Current\n207\nE\nX\nE\nR\nC\nI\nS\nE\nS\n1.\nWhich of the following correctly describes the magnetic field near a long\nstraight wire?\n(a)\nThe field consists of straight lines perpendicular to the wire.\n(b)\n The field consists of straight lines parallel to the wire.\n(c)\nThe field consists of radial lines originating from the wire.\n(d)\nThe field consists of concentric circles centred on the wire.\n2.\nAt the time of short circuit, the current in the circuit\n(a)\nreduces substantially.\n(b)\ndoes not change.\n(c)\nincreases heavily.\n(d)\nvary continuously.\n3.\nState whether the following statements are true or false.\n(a)\nThe field at the centre of a long circular coil carrying current will be\nparallel straight lines.\n(b)\nA wire with a green insulation is usually the live wire of an electric supply.\n4.\nList two methods of producing magnetic fields.\n5.\nWhen is the force experienced by a current–carrying conductor placed in a magnetic\nfield largest?\n6.\nImagine that you are sitting in a chamber with your back to one wall.

The blue-green colour of the solution is\ndue to the formation of copper(II) chloride in the reaction. The general\nreaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as –\nMetal oxide + Acid → Salt + Water\nMetal carbonate/Metal hydrogencarbonate + Acid → Salt + Carbon dioxide + Water\n2.1.4 How do Acids and Bases React with each other?\n2024-25\n\nScience\n22\nNow write and balance the equation for the above reaction. Since\nmetallic oxides react with acids to give salts and water, similar to the\nreaction of a base with an acid, metallic oxides are said to be basic oxides.\n2.1.6 Reaction of a Non-metallic Oxide with Base\nYou saw the reaction between carbon dioxide and calcium hydroxide\n(lime water) in Activity 2.5. Calcium hydroxide, which is a base, reacts\nwith carbon dioxide to produce a salt and water. Since this is similar to\nthe reaction between a base and an acid, we can conclude that non-\nmetallic oxides are acidic in nature.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhy should curd and sour substances not be kept in brass and copper\nvessels?\n2.\nWhich gas is usually liberated when an acid reacts with a metal?\nIllustrate with an example.

What leads to this similarity in properties? We saw in Activity\n2.3 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals, so\nhydrogen seems to be common to all acids. Let us perform an Activity to\ninvestigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic.\nActivity 2.8\nActivity 2.8\nActivity 2.8\nActivity 2.8\nActivity 2.8\nn\nTake \nsolutions \nof \nglucose, \nalcohol,\nhydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, etc.\nn\nFix two nails on a cork, and place the cork in\na 100 mL beaker.\nn\nConnect the nails to the two terminals of a\n6 volt battery through a bulb and a switch, as\nshown in Fig. 2.3.\nn\nNow pour some dilute HCl in the beaker and\nswitch on the current.\nn\nRepeat with dilute sulphuric acid.\nn\nWhat do you observe?\nn\nRepeat the experiment separately with\nglucose and alcohol solutions. What do you\nobserve now?\nn\nDoes the bulb glow in all cases?\nFigure 2.3\nFigure 2.3\nFigure 2.3\nFigure 2.3\nFigure 2.3\nAcid solution in water\nconducts electricity\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n23\nThe bulb will start glowing in the case of acids, as shown in Fig. 2.3.\nBut you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions.\nAcids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO3\n– in\nHNO3, SO2–\n4\n in H2SO4, CH3COO– in CH3COOH. Since the cation present in\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties.\nRepeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity?\n2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?\nDo acids produce ions only in aqueous solution?

The separation of H+ ion from HCl molecules\ncannot occur in the absence of water.\nHCl + H2O → H3O+ + Cl–\nHydrogen ions cannot exist alone, but they exist after combining\nwith water molecules. Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as\nH+(aq) or hydronium ion (H3O+).\nH+ + H2O → H3O+\nWe have seen that acids give H3O+ or H+(aq) ion in water. Let us see\nwhat happens when a base is dissolved in water.\nNaOH(s)\nH O\n2\n\n→\nNa+ (aq) + OH– (aq)\nNote to teachers: If the climate is very humid, you will have to pass the gas produced\nthrough a guard tube (drying tube) containing calcium chloride to dry the gas.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n24\nKOH(s) \nK (aq)+OH (aq)\nH O\n2\n+\n\n→\n\n–\nMg(OH)2(s)\nH O\n2\n\n→\nMg2+(aq)+2OH–(aq)\nBases generate hydroxide (OH–) ions in water. Bases which are soluble\nin water are called alkalis.\nDo You\nKnow?\nAll bases do not dissolve in water. An alkali is a base that dissolves in water. They\nare soapy to touch, bitter and corrosive. Never taste or touch them as they may\ncause harm. Which of the bases in the Table 2.1 are alkalis?\nNow as we have identified that all acids generate H+(aq) and all\nbases generate OH\n–(aq), we can view the neutralisation reaction as\nfollows –\nAcid + Base → Salt + Water\nH  X + M  OH → MX + HOH\nH+(aq) + OH\n– (aq) → H2O(l)\nLet us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base.\nActivity 2.10\nActivity 2.10\nActivity 2.10\nActivity 2.10\nActivity 2.10\nn\nTake 10 mL water in a beaker.\nn\nAdd a few drops of concentrated H2SO4 to it and swirl the\nbeaker slowly.\nn\nTouch the base of the beaker.\nn\nIs there a change in temperature?\nn\nIs this an exothermic or endothermic process?\nn\nRepeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets\nand record your observations.\nFigure 2.5\nFigure 2.5\nFigure 2.5\nFigure 2.5\nFigure 2.5\nWarning sign displayed\non containers containing\nconcentrated acids and\nbases\nThe process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly\nexothermic one. Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric\nacid or sulphuric acid with water. The acid must always be added slowly\nto water with constant stirring. If water is added to a concentrated acid,\nthe heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns.\nThe glass container may also break due to excessive local heating. Look\nout for the warning sign (shown in Fig. 2.5) on the can of concentrated\nsulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets.\nMixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the\nconcentration of ions (H3O+/OH–) per unit volume. Such a process is\ncalled dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted.\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n25\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\n2.3 HOW STRONG ARE ACID OR BASE SOLUTIONS?\nWe know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions.\nCan we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution?\nCan we judge how strong a given acid or base is?\nWe can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.\nA scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value.\nThe pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6). Generally paper impregnated\nwith the universal indicator is used for measuring pH.\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhy do HCl, HNO3, etc., show acidic characters in aqueous solutions\nwhile solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic\ncharacter?\n2.\nWhy does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity?\n3.\nWhy does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper?\n4.\nWhile diluting an acid, why is it recommended that the acid should be\nadded to water and not water to the acid?\n5.\nHow is the concentration of hydronium ions (H3O+) affected when a\nsolution of an acid is diluted?\n6.\nHow is the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH\n–) affected when excess\nbase is dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide?\nFigure 2.6\nFigure 2.6\nFigure 2.6\nFigure 2.6\nFigure 2.6 Variation of pH with the change in concentration of  H+(aq) and OH–(aq) ions\n2024-25\n\nScience\n26\nActivity 2.11\nActivity 2.11\nActivity 2.11\nActivity 2.11\nActivity 2.11\nn\nTest the pH values\nof solutions given in\nTable 2.2.\nn\nRecord your observations.\nn\nWhat is the nature of each\nsubstance on the basis of\nyour observations?\nFigure 2.7 \nFigure 2.7 \nFigure 2.7 \nFigure 2.7 \nFigure 2.7 pH of some common substances shown on a pH paper (colours are only a rough guide)\nThe strength of acids and bases depends on the number of H+ ions\nand OH– ions produced, respectively. If we take hydrochloric acid and\nacetic acid of the same concentration, say one molar, then these produce\ndifferent amounts of hydrogen ions. Acids that give rise to more H+ ions\nare said to be strong acids, and acids that give less H+ ions are said to be\nweak acids. Can you now say what weak and strong bases are?\n2.3.1 Impor\n2.3.1 Impor\n2.3.1 Impor\n2.3.1 Impor\n2.3.1 Importance of pH in Ever\ntance of pH in Ever\ntance of pH in Ever\ntance of pH in Ever\ntance of pH in Everyday Life\nyday Life\nyday Life\nyday Life\nyday Life\nAre plants and animals pH sensitive?\nOur body works within the pH range of 7.0 to 7.8. Living organisms can\nsurvive only in a narrow range of pH change. When pH of rain water is\nless than 5.6, it is called acid rain. When acid rain flows into the rivers, it\nlowers the pH of the river water. The survival of aquatic life in such rivers\nbecomes difficult.\nTable 2.2\n S.\nSolution\nColour of\nApprox-\nNature of\nNo.\npH paper\n-imate\nsubstance\npH value\n1\nSaliva (before meal)\n2\nSaliva (after meal)\n3\nLemon juice\n4\nColourless aerated\ndrink\n5\nCarrot juice\n6\nCoffee\n7\nTomato juice\n8\nTap water\n9\n1M NaOH\n10\n1M HCl\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n27\nWhat is the pH of the soil in your backyard?\nPlants require a specific pH range for their healthy growth. To find out\nthe pH required for the healthy growth of a plant, you can collect the soil\nfrom various places and check the pH in the manner described below in\nActivity 2.12. Also, you can note down which plants are growing in the\nregion from which you have collected the soil.\nAcids in other planets\nThe atmosphere of venus is made up of thick white and yellowish clouds of\nsulphuric acid.

It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach.\nDuring indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.\nMagnesium hydroxide (Milk of magnesia), a mild base, is often used for\nthis purpose.\npH change as the cause of tooth decay\nTooth decay starts when the pH of the mouth is lower than 5.5. Tooth\nenamel, made up of calcium hydroxyapatite (a crystalline form of calcium\nphosphate) is the hardest substance in the body. It does not dissolve in\nwater, but is corroded when the pH in the mouth is below 5.5. Bacteria\npresent in the mouth produce acids by degradation of sugar and food\nparticles remaining in the mouth after eating. The best way to prevent\nthis is to clean the mouth after eating food. Using toothpastes, which are\ngenerally basic, for cleaning the teeth can neutralise the excess acid and\nprevent tooth decay.\nSelf defence by animals and plants through chemical warfare\nHave you ever been stung by a honey-bee? Bee-sting leaves an acid\nwhich  causes pain and irritation. Use of a mild base like baking soda\non the stung area gives relief.

This is the salt that you use in food.\nYou must have observed in the above Activity\nthat it is a neutral salt.\nSeawater contains many salts dissolved\nin it. Sodium chloride is separated from these\nsalts. Deposits of solid salt are also found in\nseveral parts of the world. These large crystals\nare often brown due to impurities. This is\ncalled rock salt. Beds of rock salt were formed\nwhen seas of bygone ages dried up. Rock salt\nis mined like coal.\nYou must have heard about Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March. Did\nyou know that sodium chloride was such an important symbol in our\nstruggle for freedom?\nTable 2.4\nSalt\npH\nAcid used\nBase used\n2024-25\n\nScience\n30\nCommon salt — A raw material for chemicals\nThe common salt thus obtained is an important raw material for various\nmaterials of daily use, such as sodium hydroxide, baking soda, washing\nsoda, bleaching powder and many more. Let us see how one substance\nis used for making all these different substances.\nSodium hydroxide\nWhen electricity is passed through an aqueous solution of sodium\nchloride (called brine), it decomposes to form sodium hydroxide. The\nprocess is called the chlor-alkali process because of the products formed–\nchlor for chlorine and alkali for sodium hydroxide.\n2NaCl(aq) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)\nChlorine gas is given off at the anode, and hydrogen gas at the cathode.\nSodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode. The three\nproducts produced in this process are all useful. Figure 2.8 shows the\ndifferent uses of these products.\nBleaching powder\nYou have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the\nelectrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride (brine). This chlorine gas is used\nfor the manufacture of bleaching powder. Bleaching powder is produced\nby the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime [Ca(OH)2]. Bleaching powder\nis represented as CaOCl2, though the actual composition is quite\ncomplex.\nCa(OH)2 + Cl2 → CaOCl2 + H2O\nFigure 2.8\nFigure 2.8\nFigure 2.8\nFigure 2.8\nFigure 2.8 Important products from the chlor-alkali process\n2024-25\n\nAcids, Bases and Salts\n31\nBleaching powder is used –\n(i)\nfor bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry, for bleaching\nwood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes\nin laundry;\n(ii)\nas an oxidising agent in many chemical industries; and\n(iii)\nto make drinking water free from germs.\nBaking soda\nThe baking soda is commonly used in the kitchen for making tasty crispy\npakoras, etc. Sometimes it is added for faster cooking. The chemical\nname of the compound is sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3).

In this Chapter we will study about some more interesting\ncompounds and their properties. Also, we shall be learning about carbon,\nan element which is of immense significance to us in both its elemental\nform and in the combined form.\nThings made\nThings made\nOthers\nof metal\nof glass/clay\nActivity 4.1\nActivity 4.1\nActivity 4.1\nActivity 4.1\nActivity 4.1\nn\nMake a list of ten things you have used\nor consumed since the morning.\nn\nCompile this list with the lists made by\nyour classmates and then sort the items\ninto the adjacent Table.\nn\nIf there are items which are made up of\nmore than one material, put them into\nboth the relevant columns of the table.\nLook at the items that come in the last column of the above table\nfilled by you – your teacher will be able to tell you that most of them are\nmade up of compounds of carbon. Can you think of a method to test\nthis? What would be the product if a compound containing carbon is\nburnt? Do you know of any test to confirm this?\nFood, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed\nare all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living\nstructures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s\ncrust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only\n0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogen-\ncarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon\ndioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the\nimportance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter, we will know\nabout the properties of carbon which make carbon so important to us.\n4.1 BONDING IN CARBON – THE COVALENT BOND\nIn the previous Chapter, we have studied the properties of ionic\ncompounds. We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling\npoints and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n59\nsaw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these\nproperties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds.\nMost carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we\nhave seen in Chapter 2. From the data\ngiven in Table 4.1 on the boiling and\nmelting points of the carbon compounds,\nwe find that these compounds have low\nmelting and boiling points as compared\nto ionic compounds (Chapter 3). We can\nconclude that the forces of attraction\nbetween the molecules are not very\nstrong. Since these compounds are\nlargely non-conductors of electricity, we\ncan conclude that the bonding in these\ncompounds does not give rise to any ions.\nIn Class IX, we learnt about the\ncombining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the\nnumber of valence electrons. Let us now look at the electronic\nconfiguration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would\nbe the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many\nvalence electrons will carbon have?\nWe know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency\nto attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas\nconfiguration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either\ngaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon,\nit has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four\nelectrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose\nelectrons –\n(i)\nIt could gain four electrons forming C4– anion. But it would be difficult\nfor the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is,\nfour extra electrons.\n(ii)\nIt could lose four electrons forming C4+ cation. But it would require\na large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a\ncarbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two\nelectrons.\nCarbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with\nother atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon,\nbut many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this\nmanner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both\nthe atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration.\nBefore going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple\nmolecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons.\nThe simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen.\nAs you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence\nhydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron\nto fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a\nmolecule of hydrogen, H2. This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the\nTable 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some\ncompounds of carbon\nCompound\nMelting\nBoiling\npoint (K)\npoint (K)\nAcetic acid (CH3COOH)\n290\n391\nChloroform (CHCl3)\n209\n334\nEthanol (CH3CH2OH)\n156\n351\nMethane (CH4)\n90\n111\n2024-25\n\nScience\n60\nFigure 4.4\nFigure 4.4\nFigure 4.4\nFigure 4.4\nFigure 4.4\nTriple bond between\ntwo nitrogen atoms\nFigure 4.3\nFigure 4.3\nFigure 4.3\nFigure 4.3\nFigure 4.3\nDouble bond between\ntwo oxygen atoms\nelectronic configuration of the nearest noble gas,\nhelium, which has two electrons in its K shell. We can\ndepict this using dots or crosses to represent valence\nelectrons (Fig. 4.1).\nThe shared pair of electrons is said to constitute a\nsingle covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms.\nA single covalent bond is also represented by a line\nbetween the two atoms, as shown in Fig. 4.2.\nThe atomic number of chlorine is 17. What would be its electronic\nconfiguration and its valency? Chlorine forms a diatomic molecule, Cl2.\nCan you draw the electron dot structure for this molecule? Note that\nonly the valence shell electrons need to be depicted.\nIn the case of oxygen, we see the formation of a double bond between\ntwo oxygen atoms. This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons\nin its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two\nmore electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two\nelectrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in\nFig. 4.3. The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to\ntwo shared pairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a double bond\nbetween the two atoms.\nCan you now depict a molecule of water showing the nature\nof bonding between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen\natoms? Does the molecule have single bonds or double bonds?\nWhat would happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of\nnitrogen? Nitrogen has the atomic number 7. What would be\nits electronic configuration and its combining capacity? In\norder to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of\nnitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared\npairs of electrons. This is said to constitute a triple bond\nbetween the two atoms. The electron dot structure of N2 and\nits triple bond can be depicted as in Fig. 4.4.\nA molecule of ammonia has the formula NH3. Can you draw\nthe electron dot structure for this molecule showing how all\nfour atoms achieve noble gas configuration? Will the molecule\nhave single, double or triple bonds?\nLet us now take a look at methane, which is a compound\nof carbon. Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major\ncomponent of bio-gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It\nis also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon.\nMethane has a formula CH4. Hydrogen, as you know, has a\nvalency of 1. Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence\nelectrons. In order to achieve noble gas configuration, carbon\nshares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen as shown\nin Fig. 4.5.\nSuch bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair\nbetween two atoms are known as covalent bonds. Covalently bonded\nmolecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter-\nmolecular forces are weak. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling\nFigure 4.1\nFigure 4.1\nFigure 4.1\nFigure 4.1\nFigure 4.1\nA molecule of hydrogen\nFigure 4.2\nFigure 4.2\nFigure 4.2\nFigure 4.2\nFigure 4.2\nSingle bond between\ntwo hydrogen atoms\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n61\nThese two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different\nphysical properties even though their chemical properties are the same. Diamond is\nthe hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery. Graphite is also\na very good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals that you studied in the\nprevious Chapter.\nDiamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and\ntemperature. These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable\nfrom natural diamonds.\nFullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. The first one to be identified was\nC-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football. Since this looked\nlike the geodesic dome designed by the US architect Buckminster Fuller, the molecule\nwas named fullerene.\nThe structure of diamond\nThe structure of C-60\nBuckminsterfullerene\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n?\n1.\nWhat would be the electron dot structure of carbon dioxide which has\nthe formula CO2?\n2.\nWhat would be the electron dot structure of a molecule of sulphur which\nis made up of eight atoms of sulphur?

Since the electrons are shared between\natoms and no charged particles are formed, such covalent compounds\nare generally poor conductors of electricity.\nAllotropes of carbon\nThe element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with\nwidely varying physical properties. Both diamond and\ngraphite are formed by carbon atoms, the difference lies in\nthe manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one\nanother. In diamond, each carbon atom is bonded to four\nother carbon atoms forming a rigid three-dimensional\nstructure. In graphite, each carbon atom is bonded to three\nother carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array.\nOne of these bonds is a double-bond, and thus the valency of\ncarbon is satisfied. Graphite structure is formed by the\nhexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other.\nMore to Know!\nThe structure of graphite\n2024-25\n\nScience\n62\n4.2 VERSATILE NATURE OF CARBON\nWe have seen the formation of covalent bonds by the sharing of\nelectrons in various elements and compounds. We have also seen the\nstructure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning\nof the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In\nfact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers\nof carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was\nrecently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large\nmargin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together.\nWhy is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element?\nThe nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number\nof compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are –\n(i)\nCarbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of\ncarbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called\ncatenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon,\nbranched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings.\nIn addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple\nbonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single\nbonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds.\nCompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their\ncarbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds.\nNo other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds. Silicon forms compounds with\nhydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these\ncompounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong\nand hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds\nwith many carbon atoms linked to each other.\n(ii)\nSince carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with\nfour other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent\nelement. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to\ncompounds with specific properties which depend on the elements\nother than carbon present in the molecule.\nAgain the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are\nvery strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One\nreason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size.\nThis enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons\nstrongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are\nmuch weaker.\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n63\nOrganic compounds\nThe two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put\ntogether give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same non-carbon\natom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were\ninitially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon\ncompounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is,\nit was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler\ndisproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon\ncompounds, except for carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate\nsalts continue to be studied under organic chemistry.\n4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\n4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\n4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\n4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\n4.2.1 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds\nWe have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound\nformed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C2H6.\nIn order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon\ncompounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms\ntogether with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the\nhydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon\n(Fig. 4.6b). For example, the structure of ethane is arrived\nin the following steps –\nC—C\nStep 1\nFigure 4.6 \nFigure 4.6 \nFigure 4.6 \nFigure 4.6 \nFigure 4.6 (a) Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond\nThree valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied,\nso each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving:\nStep 2\nFigure 4.6 \nFigure 4.6 \nFigure 4.6 \nFigure 4.6 \nFigure 4.6 (b)     Each carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms\nThe electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig. 4.6(c).\nCan you draw the structure of propane, which has the molecular\nformula C3H8 in a similar manner? You will see that the valencies of all\nthe atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them. Such carbon\ncompounds are called saturated compounds. These compounds are\nnormally not very reactive.\nHowever, another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula\nC2H4 and is called ethene. How can this molecule be depicted? We follow\nthe same step-wise approach as above.\nCarbon-carbon atoms linked together with a single bond (Step 1).\nWe see that one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied\n(Step 2). This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the\ntwo carbons (Step 3).\nFigure 4.6\nFigure 4.6\nFigure 4.6\nFigure 4.6\nFigure 4.6\n(c)     Electron dot structure of\nethane\nMore to Know!\nStep 2\nStep 3\nC—C        Step 1\n2024-25\n\nScience\n64\nThe electron dot structure for ethene is given in Fig. 4.7.\nYet another compound of hydrogen and carbon has the formula\nC2H2 and is called ethyne. Can you draw the electron dot\nstructure for ethyne? How many bonds are necessary between\nthe two carbon atoms in order to satisfy their valencies? Such\ncompounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between\nthe carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds\nand they are more reactive than the saturated carbon\ncompounds.\n4.2.2 Chains, Branches and Rings\nIn the earlier section, we mentioned the carbon compounds methane,\nethane and propane, containing respectively 1, 2 and 3 carbon atoms.\nSuch ‘chains’ of carbon atoms can contain many more carbon atoms.\nThe names and structures of six of these are given in Table 4.2.\nFigure 4.7\nFigure 4.7\nFigure 4.7\nFigure 4.7\nFigure 4.7\nStructure of ethene\nTable 4.2 Formulae and structures of saturated compounds of carbon and hydrogen\nNo. of C\nName\nFormula\nStructure\natoms\n1\nMethane\nCH4\n2\nEthane\nC2H6\n3\nPropane\nC3H8\n4\nButane\nC4H10\n5\nPentane\nC5H12\n6\nHexane\nC6H14\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n65\nBut, let us take another look at butane. If we make the carbon\n‘skeleton’ with four carbon atoms, we see that two different possible\n‘skeletons’ are –\nC—C—C—C\nFigure 4.8 \nFigure 4.8 \nFigure 4.8 \nFigure 4.8 \nFigure 4.8 (a) Two possible carbon-skeletons\nFilling the remaining valencies with hydrogen gives us –\nFigure 4.8 \nFigure 4.8 \nFigure 4.8 \nFigure 4.8 \nFigure 4.8 (b) Complete molecules for two structures with formula C4H10\nWe see that both these structures have the same formula C4H10. Such\ncompounds with identical molecular formula but different structures\nare called structural isomers.\nIn addition to straight and branched carbon chains, some compounds\nhave carbon atoms arranged in the form of a ring. For example, cyclohexane\nhas the formula C6H12 and the following structure –\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4.9 \nFigure 4.9 \nFigure 4.9 \nFigure 4.9 \nFigure 4.9 Structure of cyclohexane (a) carbon skeleton (b) complete molecule\nCan you draw the electron dot structure for cyclohexane? Straight\nchain, branched chain and cyclic carbon compounds, all may be saturated\nor unsaturated. For example, benzene, C6H6, has the following structure –\nBenzene — C6H6\nFigure 4.10 \nFigure 4.10 \nFigure 4.10 \nFigure 4.10 \nFigure 4.10 Structure of benzene\nAll these carbon compounds which contain only carbon and\nhydrogen are called hydrocarbons. Among these, the saturated\nhydrocarbons are called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which\ncontain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing\none or more triple bonds are called alkynes.\n4.2.3 Will you be my Friend?\nCarbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking at\ncompounds containing carbon and hydrogen only. But carbon also forms\n2024-25\n\nScience\n66\nbonds with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur.\nIn a hydrocarbon chain, one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these\nelements, such that the valency of carbon remains satisfied. In such\ncompounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom.\nThese heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in Table 4.3.\nThese heteroatoms and\nthe group containing\nthese confer specific\nproperties \nto \nthe\ncompound, regardless\nof the length and nature\nof the carbon chain and\nhence \nare \ncalled\nfunctional groups. Some\nimportant functional\ngroups are given in the\nTable 4.3. Free valency or\nvalencies of the group\nare shown by the single\nline. The functional group\nis attached to the carbon\nchain through this\nvalency by replacing one\nhydrogen   atom or\natoms.\n4.2.4 Homologous Series\nYou have seen that carbon atoms can be linked together to form chains\nof varying lengths. These chains can be branched also. In addition,\nhydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced\nby any of the functional groups that we saw above. The presence of a\nfunctional group such as alcohol decides the properties of the carbon\ncompound, regardless of the length of the carbon chain. For example,\nthe chemical properties of CH3OH, C2H5OH, C3H7OH and C4H9OH are all\nvery similar. Hence, such a series of compounds in which the same\nfunctional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a\nhomologous series.\nLet us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table\n4.2. If we look at the formulae of successive compounds, say –\nCH4 and C2H6\n—\nthese differ by a –CH2- unit\nC2H6 and C3H8\n—\nthese differ by a –CH2- unit\nWhat is the difference between the next pair – propane and butane (C4H10)?\nCan you find out the difference in molecular masses between these\npairs (the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen\nis 1 u)?\nSimilarly, take the homologous series for alkenes. The first member\nof the series is ethene which we have already come across in\nSection 4.2.1. What is the formula for ethene? The succeeding members\nhave the formula C3H6, C4H8 and C5H10. Do these also differ by a –CH2–\nTable 4.3 Some functional groups in carbon compounds\nHetero\nHetero\nHetero\nHetero\nHetero\nClass of\nClass of\nClass of\nClass of\nClass of\nFormula of\nFormula of\nFormula of\nFormula of\nFormula of\natom\natom\natom\natom\natom\ncompounds\ncompounds\ncompounds\ncompounds\ncompounds\nfunctional group\nfunctional group\nfunctional group\nfunctional group\nfunctional group\nCl/Br\nHalo- (Chloro/bromo)\n—Cl, —Br\nalkane\n(substitutes for\nhydrogen atom)\nOxygen\n1.

The general formula for alkenes\ncan be written as CnH2n, where n = 2, 3, 4. Can you similarly generate the\ngeneral formula for alkanes and alkynes?\nAs the molecular mass increases in any homologous series, a\ngradation in physical properties is seen. This is because the melting and\nboiling points increase with increasing molecular mass. Other physical\nproperties such as solubility in a particular solvent also show a similar\ngradation. But the chemical properties, which are determined solely by\nthe functional group, remain similar in a homologous series.\nActivity 4.2\nActivity 4.2\nActivity 4.2\nActivity 4.2\nActivity 4.2\n4.2.5 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds\nThe names of compounds in a homologous series are based on the name\nof the basic carbon chain modified by a “prefix” “phrase before” or “suffix”\n“phrase after” indicating the nature of the functional group. For example,\nthe names of the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol,\npropanol and butanol.\nNaming a carbon compound can be done by the following method –\n(i)\nIdentify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. A compound\nhaving three carbon atoms would have the name propane.\n(ii)\nIn case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the\nname of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given\nin Table 4.4).\n(iii)\nIf the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, and the\nsuffix of the functional group begins with a vowel a, e, i, o, u, then\nthe name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and\nadding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain\nwith a ketone group would be named in the following manner –\nPropane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone.\n(iv)\nIf the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name\nof the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in\nTable 4.4. For example, a three-carbon chain with a double bond\nwould be called propene and if it has a triple bond, it would be\ncalled propyne.\nn\nCalculate the difference in the formulae and molecular masses\nfor (a) CH3OH and C2H5OH (b) C2H5OH and C3H7OH, and (c) C3H7OH\nand C4H9OH.\nn\nIs there any similarity in these three?\nn\nArrange these alcohols in the order of increasing carbon atoms to\nget a family.

Since most of the fuels we use are either carbon\nor its compounds, we shall first study combustion.\n4.3.1 Combustion\n4.3.1 Combustion\n4.3.1 Combustion\n4.3.1 Combustion\n4.3.1 Combustion\nCarbon, in all its allotropic forms, burns in oxygen to give carbon dioxide\nalong with the release of heat and light. Most carbon compounds also\nrelease a large amount of heat and light on burning. These are the\noxidation reactions that you learnt about in the first Chapter –\n(i)\nC + O2 → CO2 + heat and light\n(ii)\nCH4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O + heat and light\n(iii)\nCH3CH2OH + O2 → CO2 + H2O + heat and light\nBalance the latter two reactions like you learnt in the first Chapter.\nActivity 4.3\nActivity 4.3\nActivity 4.3\nActivity 4.3\nActivity 4.3\nCAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance.\nn Take some carbon compounds (naphthalene,\ncamphor, alcohol) one by one on a spatula and burn\nthem.\nn Observe the nature of the flame and note whether\nsmoke is produced.\nn Place a metal plate above the flame. Is there a deposition\non the plate in case of any of the compounds?\nActivity 4.4\nActivity 4.4\nActivity 4.4\nActivity 4.4\nActivity 4.4\nn\nLight a bunsen burner and\nadjust the air hole at the\nbase to get different types of\nflames/presence of smoke.\nn\nWhen do you get a yellow,\nsooty flame?\nn\nWhen do you get a blue\nflame?\nSaturated hydrocarbons will generally give a clean flame while\nunsaturated carbon compounds will give a yellow flame with lots of\nblack smoke. This results in a sooty deposit on the metal plate in Activity\n4.3. However, limiting the supply of air results in incomplete combustion\nof even saturated hydrocarbons giving a sooty flame. The gas/kerosene\nstove used at home has inlets for air so that a sufficiently oxygen-rich\n2024-25\n\nScience\n70\nmixture is burnt to give a clean blue flame. If you observe the bottoms of\ncooking vessels getting blackened, it means that the air holes are blocked\nand fuel is getting wasted. Fuels such as coal and petroleum have some\namount of nitrogen and sulphur in them. Their combustion results in\nthe formation of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen which are major\npollutants in the environment.\nDo You Know?\nWhy do substances burn with or without a flame?\nHave you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a\nchance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You\nhave seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However,\nyou will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and\ngives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous\nsubstances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present\nvapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning.\nA luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and\nstart to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of\nthat element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its\ncolour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On\nthis basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to?\nFormation of coal and petroleum\nCoal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to\nvarious biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and\nother plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth,\nperhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of\nearth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions\nof tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to\nthe sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning\nthem into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to.\nMeanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the\nporous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you guess why\ncoal and petroleum are called fossil fuels?\n4.3.2 Oxidation\nActivity 4.5\nActivity 4.5\nActivity 4.5\nActivity 4.5\nActivity 4.5\nn\nTake about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube and warm it\ngently in a water bath.\nn\nAdd a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate\ndrop by drop to this solution.\nn\nDoes the colour of potassium permanganate persist when\nit is added initially?\nn\nWhy does the colour of potassium permanganate not\ndisappear when excess is added?\nYou have learnt\nabout oxidation reactions in\nthe first Chapter. Carbon\ncompounds can be easily\noxidised on combustion. In\naddition to this complete\noxidation, we have reactions\nin which alcohols are\nconverted to carboxylic\nacids –\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n71\nWe see that some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others.\nThese substances are known as oxidising agents.\nAlkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate\nare oxidising alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the starting\nmaterial. Hence they are known as oxidising agents.\n4.3.3 Addition Reaction\nUnsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts\nsuch as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts\nare substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different\nrate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly\nused in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst.\nVegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while\nanimal fats have saturated carbon chains.\nYou must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils\nare ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which\nare said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids\nshould be chosen for cooking.\n4.3.4 Substitution Reaction\nSaturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence\nof most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added\nto hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen\natoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type\nof atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of\nproducts are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.\nCH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl (in the presence of sunlight)\n?\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n1.\nWhy is the conversion of ethanol to ethanoic acid an oxidation reaction?\n2.\nA mixture of oxygen and ethyne is burnt for welding. Can you tell why\na mixture of ethyne and air is not used?\n4.4 SOME IMPORTANT CARBON COMPOUNDS – ETHANOL\nAND ETHANOIC ACID\nMany carbon compounds are invaluable to us. But here we shall study\nthe properties of two commercially important compounds – ethanol and\nethanoic acid.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n72\n4.4.1 Properties of Ethanol\nEthanol is a liquid at room temperature (refer to Table 4.1 for the melting\nand boiling points of ethanol). Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and\nis the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a\ngood solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough\nsyrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all\nproportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes\ndrunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially\nwidespread practice. However, intake of even a small quantity of pure\nethanol (called absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term\nconsumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.\nReactions of Ethanol\nReactions of Ethanol\nReactions of Ethanol\nReactions of Ethanol\nReactions of Ethanol\n(i) Reaction with sodium –\nActivity 4.6\nActivity 4.6\nActivity 4.6\nActivity 4.6\nActivity 4.6\nTeacher’s demonstration –\nn\nDrop a small piece of sodium,\nabout the size of a couple of\ngrains of rice, into ethanol\n(absolute alcohol).\nn\nWhat do you observe?\nn\nHow will you test the gas evolved?\n2Na + 2CH3CH2OH → 2CH3CH2O–Na+ + H2\n (Sodium ethoxide)\nAlcohols react with sodium leading to the\nevolution of hydrogen. With ethanol, the other\nproduct is sodium ethoxide. Can you recall which\nother substances produce hydrogen on reacting with\nmetals?\n(ii)\nReaction to give unsaturated hydrocarbon: Heating ethanol at\n443 K with excess concentrated sulphuric acid results in the\ndehydration of ethanol to give ethene –\nCH\nCH OH\nCH  = CH  + H O\n3\n2\n2\n2\n2\nHot Conc.\nH SO\n2\n4\n−\n\n→\n\nThe concentrated sulphuric acid can be regarded as a dehydrating\nagent which removes water from ethanol.\nHow do alcohols affect living beings?\nWhen large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to slow metabolic processes\nand to depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination,\nmental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupor.\nThe individual may feel relaxed without realising that his sense of judgement, sense\nof timing, and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired.\nUnlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol\nis oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of\ncells. It coagulates the protoplasm, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by\ncooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness.\nEthanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced\nfor industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances\nlike methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue so that it can be\nidentified easily. This is called denatured alcohol.\nDo You Know?\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n73\n4.4.2 Properties of Ethanoic Acid\nEthanoic acid is commonly called acetic acid and\nbelongs to a group of acids called carboxylic\nacids. 5-8% solution of acetic acid in water is\ncalled vinegar and is used widely as a preservative\nin pickles. The melting point of pure ethanoic acid\nis 290 K and hence it often freezes during winter\nin cold climates. This gave rise to its name glacial\nacetic acid.\nThe group of organic compounds called\ncarboxylic acids are obviously characterised by\ntheir acidic nature. However, unlike mineral acids\nlike HCl, which are completely ionised, carboxylic\nacids are weak acids.\nActivity 4.7\nActivity 4.7\nActivity 4.7\nActivity 4.7\nActivity 4.7\nn\nCompare the pH of dilute acetic acid\nand dilute hydrochloric acid using\nboth litmus paper and universal\nindicator.\nn\nAre both acids indicated by the\nlitmus test?\nn\nDoes the universal indicator show\nthem as equally strong acids?\nActivity 4.8\nActivity 4.8\nActivity 4.8\nActivity 4.8\nActivity 4.8\nn\nTake 1 mL ethanol (absolute alcohol)\nand 1 mL glacial acetic acid along\nwith a few drops of concentrated\nsulphuric acid in a test tube.\nn\nWarm in a water-bath for at least five\nminutes as shown in Fig. 4.11.\nn\nPour into a beaker containing\n20-50 mL of water and smell the\nresulting mixture.\nReactions of ethanoic acid:\nReactions of ethanoic acid:\nReactions of ethanoic acid:\nReactions of ethanoic acid:\nReactions of ethanoic acid:\n(i)\nEsterification reaction: Esters are most commonly\nformed by reaction of an acid and an alcohol.\nEthanoic acid reacts with absolute ethanol in the\npresence of an acid catalyst to give an ester –\nCH\nCOOH\nCH\nCH OH\nCH\nC\nC CH\nCH\nH O\n3\n3\n2\n3\n2\n3\n2\nAcid\nO\n(E\n−\n+\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n+\n11\nthanoic acid)            (Ethanol)                               (Ester)\nO\nGenerally, esters are sweet-smelling substances. These are used in\nmaking perfumes and as flavouring agents. On treating with sodium\nhydroxide, which is an alkali, the ester is converted back to  alcohol\nand sodium salt of carboxylic acid. This reaction is known as\nsaponification because it is used in the preparation of soap. Soaps\nare sodium or potassium salts of long chain carboxylic acid.\nFigure 4.11\nFigure 4.11\nFigure 4.11\nFigure 4.11\nFigure 4.11\nFormation of ester\nAlcohol as a fuel\nAlcohol as a fuel\nAlcohol as a fuel\nAlcohol as a fuel\nAlcohol as a fuel\nSugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical\nenergy.

Most dirt is\noily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The\nmolecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic\nacids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain\ninteracts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called\nmicelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil\ndroplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in\nwater. The soap micelle thus helps  in pulling out the dirt in water and\nwe can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13).\nCan you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if\nyou dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon?\nMicelles\nSoaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,\nthat is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts\nwith hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap\nwill not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the\nionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water,\nthese molecules have a unique orientation that keeps\nthe hydrocarbon portion out of the water. Thus,\nclusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails\nare in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends\nare on the surface of the cluster. This formation is\ncalled a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able\nto clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the\ncentre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as\na colloid and will not come together to precipitate\nbecause of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt\nsuspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away.\nThe soap micelles are large enough to scatter light.\nHence a soap solution appears cloudy.\nFigure 4.13\nFigure 4.13\nFigure 4.13\nFigure 4.13\nFigure 4.13 Effect of soap in cleaning\nMore to Know!\n2024-25\n\nScience\n76\nActivity 4.11\nActivity 4.11\nActivity 4.11\nActivity 4.11\nActivity 4.11\nn\nTake about 10 mL of distilled water (or rain water) and 10 mL of\nhard water (from a tubewell or hand-pump) in separate test tubes.\nn\nAdd a couple of drops of soap solution to both.\nn\nShake the test tubes vigorously for an equal period of time and\nobserve the amount of foam formed.\nn\nIn which test tube do you get more foam?\nn\nIn which test tube do you observe a white curdy precipitate?\nNote for the teacher : If hard water is not available in your locality,\nprepare some hard water by dissolving hydrogencarbonates/\nsulphates/chlorides of calcium or magnesium in water.\nActivity 4.12\nActivity 4.12\nActivity 4.12\nActivity 4.12\nActivity 4.12\nn\nTake two test tubes with about 10 mL of hard water in each.\nn\nAdd five drops of soap solution to one and five drops of detergent\nsolution to the other.\nn\nShake both test tubes for the same period.\nn\nDo both test tubes have the same amount of foam?\nn\nIn which test tube is a curdy solid formed?\n?\nQ\nU\nE\nS\nT\nI\nO\nN\nS\n1.\nWould you be able to check if water is hard by using a detergent?\n2.\nPeople use a variety of methods to wash clothes. Usually after adding\nthe soap, they ‘beat’ the clothes on a stone, or beat it with a paddle,\nscrub with a brush or the mixture is agitated in a washing machine.\nWhy is agitation necessary to get clean clothes?\nHave you ever observed while bathing that foam is formed with\ndifficulty and an insoluble substance (scum) remains after washing with\nwater? This is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and\nmagnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. Hence you need\nto use a larger amount of soap. This problem is overcome by using\nanother class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents.\nDetergents are generally sodium salts of sulphonic acids or ammonium\nsalts with chlorides or bromides ions, etc. Both have long hydrocarbon\nchain. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble\nprecipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Thus,\nthey remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make\nshampoos and products for cleaning clothes.\n2024-25\n\nCarbon and its Compounds\n77\nWhat you have learnt\nn\nCarbon is a versatile element that forms the basis for all living organisms and many\nof the things we use.\nn\nThis large variety of compounds is formed by carbon because of its tetravalency\nand the property of catenation that it exhibits.\nn\nCovalent bonds are formed by the sharing of electrons between two atoms so that\nboth can achieve a completely filled outermost shell.\nn\nCarbon forms covalent bonds with itself and other elements such as hydrogen,\noxygen, sulphur, nitrogen and chlorine.\nn\nCarbon also forms compounds containing double and triple bonds between carbon\natoms. These carbon chains may be in the form of straight chains, branched chains\nor rings.\nn\nThe ability of carbon to form chains gives rise to a homologous series of compounds\nin which the same functional group is attached to carbon chains of different lengths.\nn\nThe functional groups such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids\nbestow characteristic properties to the carbon compounds that contain them.\nn\nCarbon and its compounds are some of our major sources of fuels.\nn\nEthanol and ethanoic acid are carbon compounds of importance in our daily lives.\nn\nThe action of soaps and detergents is based on the presence of both hydrophobic\nand hydrophilic groups in the molecule and this helps to emulsify the oily dirt and\nhence its removal.\nE\nX\nE\nR\nC\nI\nS\nE\nS\n1.\nEthane, with the molecular formula C2H6 has\n(a)\n6 covalent bonds.\n(b)\n7 covalent bonds.\n(c)\n8 covalent bonds.\n(d)\n9 covalent bonds.\n2.\nButanone is a four-carbon compound with the functional group\n(a)\ncarboxylic acid.\n(b)\naldehyde.\n(c)\nketone.\n(d)\nalcohol.\n3.\nWhile cooking, if the bottom of the vessel is getting blackened on the outside,\nit means that\n(a)\nthe food is not cooked completely.\n(b)\nthe fuel is not burning completely.\n(c)\nthe fuel is wet.\n(d)\nthe fuel is burning completely.\n2024-25\n\nScience\n78\n4.\nExplain the nature of the covalent bond using the bond formation in CH3Cl.\n5.\nDraw the electron dot structures for\n(a)\nethanoic acid.\n(b)\nH2S.\n(c)\npropanone.\n(d)\nF2 .\n6.\nWhat is an homologous series?
